<p class="western">The witch stood before the glowing stone of
power, reaching deep into its heart, she sensed and felt the
environment both inside of the stone, and out there on the
battlefield. She felt the first reaching out by Nailstead as a
twitch in the ether, she felt the conjuration he was describing in
his mind and understood the intent behind it. She could see through
the stones ancient power the snows billowing around and across the
plain, she watched the storm that she had created using the stone,
as it raged, and she knew that soon it would cease.</p>
<p class="western">She prepared for the battle to come, a battle
of magic's. Below her the earth near the front of her cave home
split, she glanced into the future held locked within another
quadrant of the multi-faceted stone. So they have arrived she
thought, she had been expecting them, but had not known exactly
where and when they would arrive. She watched through her art and
the power of the stone as troll fingers tore out of the ground. She
watched as the huge powerful creatures pulled themselves up and
onto the rocks before her cave. She watched unconcerned by their
presence, unthreatened by their intent.</p>
<p class="western">Separating a part of herself from the
bindings of the stone she turned to look across the cavern. Seated
upright, looking terrified was a young man only just past being a
boy. Held as though his life depended on it in his arms was a jug,
containing nothing more threatening than water, clean, pure, rock
filtered water.</p>
<p class="western">"Boy" she called startling him from his
fear.</p>
<p class="western">"Come here!" She beckoned him with one long
finger.</p>
<p class="western">The boy stood, clutching his jug and slowly,
almost hesitantly, he walked towards her. In his mind he felt his
fear fade until it vanished. He stood before her; she who he knew
controlled the awesome power of the stone, wondering what she could
want with him, wondering why he had been summoned to sit in this
cavern with them, her coven swirling all around him. He so far had
been ignored but now she summoned him. Wraith like, witches parted,
allowing him to approach her, before resuming doing whatever it was
that they had been doing.</p>
<p class="western">He was not even aware that his fear had been
banished by her, nor that she had great need of his presence, or
that his life was about to change forever.</p>
<p class="western">"Your name boy?" She demanded already knowing
it, she had known of this boy, and this coming moment in time since
before she had transmuted from the dark magic of her past, to the
white magic she now portrayed to those around her.</p>
<p class="western">"Vindec, mistress witch! My name is Vindec."
He managed to force out between fast drying lips, why he called
himself that name he did not know it was not his, but still he used
it. She looked at him, seemingly absorbing and assessing him,
making him feel as though each and every facet of his being was
being examined in minute detail, it was. Had he understood exactly
how minute that detail was, he would have run screaming from her
presence, but he did not understand. So he stood looking confused,
hugging his water jug and waiting to learn what it was that she
expected of him?</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Below the cavern in which the witch examined
the boy now called Vindec, the troll's were gathered together.
They, all four of them pounded the ground with their feet, growling
in anger as they approached the entry to the cavern. Soon they were
pounding the rock doorway with their fists, hammering into the
granite walls, shattering huge chunks from the stone facing,
forcing an entry to open up before them.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The witch ignored the pounding arising from
her caverns front entry, fixing instead her free attention onto the
boy before her. Wondering if he really could be the keeper for all
time, this boy, this pathetic looking boy, who a few seconds ago
was quaking in fear of her, how could he be the guardian she knew
him to be, she wondered and worried?</p>
<p class="western">She reached into his mind feeling his life,
blanking it out, erasing it for all time, creating a clearness of
thought that he would need in the future. She replaced all that he
had known, all that he had learnt in his short life, with all that
she now knew, all that she had learnt over decades of life. She
changed him forever, granting him both power and understanding, but
allowing him to keep his free will. She did not control the boy
Vindec, she had only created the magician he now was.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec looked up at her, his eyes clear,
penetrating, understanding all that she had imparted. The boy was
gone; the water carrying boy was now replaced with a fully
conscious, highly knowledgeable man, a man with a deep
understanding of his role in life. All memory of what he had been
vanished; he was now Vindec, warlock, mage and a power to be feared
within the coven.</p>
<p class="western">He looked down feeling the weight of the jug
nestling in his hands, a slight look of mirth scattered across his
face before he turned away from the witch. He would deal with the
invading nuisances; he would crush the rock troll's, capturing and
containing them in a way that seemed suitable to him. He left the
cavern, walking unhurriedly along a little used passageway.
Reaching out, Vindec felt the rock beneath his feet responding to
his mental call.</p>
<p class="western">What was the entrance to the witch's coven
had changed as the rock trolls had approached it. Huge slabs of
granite had slid together forming into a seamless wall, remaking
where there had been an entry. The troll's, their anger
uncontrolled unleashed a violence so fanatical against the new rock
face, that the whole mountain seemed to shake. Fists punched into
the stone which now separated them from their goal once more.
Gradually the rock splintered again and parted, until finally
allowing them inside. The passageway was clear, as one behind the
other the troll's marched forward, driven onward by Nailstead's
instructions.</p>
<p class="western">"Kill the witch," could be heard as they
chanted together, powerful shoulders brushing to either side of the
entry.</p>
<p class="western">"Kill the witch, kill the wit...".</p>
<p class="western">The tunnel bore to the left entering into a
round room, disgorging them into a dead end, one mentally created
by Vindec the new warlock only moments earlier. Behind them the
rock tunnel closed, trapping all four of the powerful creatures,
that alone would not contain them and Vindec understood the
necessity for him to act.</p>
<p class="western">High above the sealed room Vindec pointed a
finger casually towards the stone of the floor. A small hole opened
up, widening to about six inches and boring down through the
granite until it met with the new room below. A smile flittered
again across the warlock's face, as slowly he tilted the water jug
he still carried, tipping it towards the new hole he had created.
Water splattered then poured from the jug, chugging down the tiny
tunnel to spray from the roof over the trapped rock troll's.</p>
<p class="western">They in response battered harder against the
rock that imprisoned them, damaging it, but failing to make it
part. Again and again they punched fists into stone, again the rock
resisted as the water fell from the roof with it hole. Gallons of
water poured from the jug, Vindec watched, aware of the
impossibility of what he was doing, but doing it anyway. Slowly
below him he realised that the room would be filling up with water.
That alone would not kill the troll's, drowning them was not an
option, but what he had in mind certainly was.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">All twelve of the swirling coven halted as
one, each drawn to face the stone and the witch standing before it.
They fell to their knees heads bowed to the floor waiting for the
union to occur.</p>
<p class="western">The witch reached out touching the cold
stone, peeling its layers open with her mind, entering into the
Elvin stone of power. She understood its capabilities, it could
magnify a user's power, reach out into the world and shift
everything to match the user's wish, but the stone had one limit,
it did not live, it could not act alone, and as such it could not
meet the witch's needs without her taking one final step. A step
that would change the stone and her for all time, a step that
could, if abused, destroy all, equally as well as it could
protect.</p>
<p class="western">Inside of the stone little pockets of time
and place existed, allowing the witch to look out beyond her cavern
and to see not only what is happening, but what will be happening.
And to change what she did not like for something that could suit
her better. She could see the King sitting at the base of the
ancient tree. She could see the Elf, Iffilditch reaching towards
the King's chest. In the distance far away still, she could see the
Dwarf racing to his King's side. She understood the true meaning of
what she saw, she understood the prophesies written in high Elvin,
she had been present when some of them were created. She understood
her role and accepted it willingly.</p>
<p class="western">With a last glance around she departed the
cavern forever, entering her spirit into the stone. She had gifted
the young boy Vindec with all that he would now need, and he, even
now, was learning and adapting to his new power, and soon he would
understand and accept his new status. His new thoughts, along with
a certain scroll hidden in a room. Unknown of by any other than her
and now Vindec, would explain her requirements of him. He would
comply despite his reservations, because he was in essence partly
her, and she partly him or so she believed.</p>
<p class="western">The stone opened up allowing the witch to
enter; it reached up to her drawing her into its self in a
welcoming embrace. A Flame flickered carrying the life that was the
stone, a flame that would enlarge and become the point of
transference for witch to Lifestone. The witch desired the change,
the stone accepted the change and out there on his ridge, the dark
lord would soon sense the change, he would feel the new power and
suffer at its effect.</p>
<p class="western">The union became one, unified. The stone
expanded, glowing with a pulsing living life as it transformed from
cold dead rock, to living entity, with the ability to think and the
power to act. The stone could now protect its self should the need
arise.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Vindec watched as the water bubbled up from
the hole into which he was pouring it, the room below was now full,
water surrounded the still battling but now desperate rock trolls.
Vindec placed the jug, still half-full, on the stone floor, he
knelt down in the pool of clear water, sensing the moment, feeling
the power build inside of him. Now he thought, unleashing a single
blue bolt of light into the water. It flashed from his fingers
punching downwards, reaching the room below, before changing.</p>
<p class="western">Blue light lit up the troll's, drawing the
last of their desires to a halt, all four turned as one to face the
entity amidst them, intending to crush it to nothing. The light
pulsed once and all around it the temperature dropped, plummeting a
hundred degrees, instantly turning what had been free running water
into solid ice.</p>
<p class="western">The troll's froze with the water,
encapsulated and contained, exactly as Vindec had intended. The
threat they presented had been neutralised. He stood up, stepping
out of the water as the ice expanded upward, freezing every last
drop of water. The magic he had unleashed against the troll's would
continue forever, the patch of gurgled back water would forever be
a pool of deeply frozen ice. No amount of heat would ever thaw the
water, it was changed and inside of it, held captive, were the four
rock trolls. Only he now had the power to release his captives and
that was not necessary, yet!</p>
<p class="western">Vindec turned away from the ice pool he had
created and returned to the cavern, the witches coven still knelt
bowed before the stone, but now the stone glowed and pulsed with a
life of its own, and the witch herself was gone. Vindec knew what
she had done, in his own way he admired her, she was ancient, she
had waited, biding her time through centuries, until this point had
been reached, and now she was a part of the stone, a new type of
stone, the only one of its type, a true Lifestone.</p>
<p class="western">He sensed the part of his memory that
indicated what he must do next and listened intently. Reaching out
he caused the rock entry to reform to its original form, then
standing before the coven he raised his hands, causing them all to
look up. He wafted his fingers towards the exit and they rose, he
silently drove them from his presence, removing their limited
power, and the casual knowledge from each of their minds. Banishing
them out to join the rest of the people, each no longer a witch in
training, no longer a coven of witches, just mortal, normal, women.
Each filled with normal female wishes and as a parting gift he
imparted to each, a touch of peace.</p>
<p class="western">They, out in the world would shine above
others, but in a peaceful way. They would succeed and live happy
lives, making any partners or husbands they chose proud of them,
and all because Vindec was essentially a caring person, despite the
power he had been granted.</p>
