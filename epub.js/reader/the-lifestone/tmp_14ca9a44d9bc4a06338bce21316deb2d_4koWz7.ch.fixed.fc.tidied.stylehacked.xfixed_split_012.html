<p class="western">"Sire, the third days travel brought myself
as a captive, still strung from my wooden pole, to the first of the
plain's. We had left the forests behind us earlier in the morning,
heading once more towards towering cliff faces. Black creature's
lined those high walls, resting their bloated bodies in deep
cavities, their heads always moving and alert. They saw us, watched
us closely, but thankfully, ignored our passing, content to watch
for others who might not be so welcome."</p>
<p class="western">The rocks had a split through their center,
it was towards this split that my capturer led his troops and they
carried my bound self Sire. We passed upwards winding around
boulders, some nearly the size of this castle they were, we were
climbing all the time. That whole valley seemed to be filled to its
brim by dark shadows, which poked their heads out to watch us
passing. Halfway along that valley, a creature burst from within
one of those darkened caverns, flitting across the sky, to circle
above our heads."</p>
<p class="western">"Even my guardians reacted by ducking, as the
winged monstrosity flapped above us. It looked young, perhaps a
juvenile, Sire. There presence here implied to me that the other
less visible creatures were either parents or more likely also
juveniles. I decided that we were passing through some sort of
crèche, a training ground for these creatures. Outside, grasping
the rock faces, over looking the plains were their parents!</p>
<p class="western">"We passed beneath the inquisitive youngling.
The valley up which we marched changed character, first though, we
crossed over a hump and then began to descend, the valley beyond
us, it widening out proportionally the further we penetrated."</p>
<p class="western">"Sire, I am saddened to have to report what I
saw infront of me. The valley floor rolled out as far as I could
see from my position. Scattered in groups of tents or huddled
around fires was an army the like of which I have never expected to
encounter even in my darkest wildest dreams. Mile after mile of
deformed, warped or just odd creatures, all going about their
business, and that business was clearly war preparations. Weapons
were piled high onto carts, stacked and racked to overflowing.
Pikes, bows, spears and swords, all jumbled together; an armoury
pulled by oxen that were each massively muscled, each with a single
horn protruding from its forehead. Sire, they were creatures of
burden, creatures that would gladden a farmer with fields to
plough! They pulled their heavy loads across rough ground, through
dense grasses, up hills, always as though walking on the flat
surface of a good road!"</p>
<p class="western">"I was carried on my pole forwards and to the
right of that field of preparation, my position restricted what I
might see, but what I did struck a mortal fear for the future of
this world deep into my soul. Spider man led us towards a ring of
fires, each surrounded by creatures from my nightmares, then
through between them, following a demarked pathway towards a single
dark tent. Tusked guards stood to either side of that tent, weapons
at the port but evidently ready to be brought to the defense of the
one residing inside, who was still hidden from my sight by the
canvas. All around us seated by fires, eating or preparing to eat,
were the gathered forms of an army, some looked blankly from
pitiless eyes at me, all seemingly ready to march, eager to fight
and die. I jest not Sire, they looked every one of them, eager to
fight and more willing to die for their cause, than any glory
hunting soldier I have ever encountered, and I've known a few of
them!"</p>
<p class="western">"They placed my pole into supports clearly
designed to hold those bound as I was, and departed to the nearest
empty fire, leaving me hanging, wondering what was going to happen
to me? My pack with my cloak still wrapped tight was thrown to the
ground, just inches away from me, but unobtainable as far as they
and I were concerned. The spider man unlike his companions ignored
the lure of food and warmth he was fast approaching the creatures
guarding the tent flaps instead. Now would appear to be a fine time
to affect my escape I decided."</p>
<p class="western">"I glanced upwards, trying to look innocuous
whilst eagerly scanning the sky, assuring myself that the ring of
black wings, which endlessly circled the large plain were high up
and disinterested in me. Then Sire, I used this."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The dwarf leant forwards extending his left
arm out over my table towards me. I leant forwards in response to
his gesture, wondering what he was showing me. He pulled back his
loose sleeve, revealing a leather bracelet and a very thick, hairy
arm above it. I looked, but there was nothing, he was implying that
somehow he knew that he could escape, that he had only waited to
select the proper time to disappear; the how eluded me, much as it
must have eluded his captors. His presence infront of me implied
that he had escaped, so there must be something, but still nothing
became apparent.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Sire all that I needed to escape from the
clutches of my captors was my pack and in particular the object
tightly rolled up atop of it. The pack was there infront of my
nose, its precious cargo secure and almost within my reach; all I
had to do was get it and I was free of the enemies camp, but first
I needed to get free of my bindings before getting the rest of me
free of the situation. I reached around the pole working my fingers
like his."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">He held out his thick wrist to towards me,
entwining his stubby heavily calloused fingers together until his
right hand reached over his left and touched a simple part of the
stitching on his wristlet. As the tips brushed against the threads
of the pattern, a distinctive click filled the air, than there
before me sprang out a thin steel shive. A blade of fine steel,
edged to perfection, I understood instantly, the concealed blade
would quickly make short work of his bonds.</p>
<p class="western">I smiled at my wily dwarf, glad that he was
loyal to me and not in my opposition, because I now know as if I
had any doubts exactly how dangerous an opponent he would make.
Having demonstrated his trick blade, he carefully folded it back
into its sheath once more. Sheath is now the only name that seems
applicable for the object on his wrist, it no longer being an
affectation, or even a decoration. I realised that there were no
such affectations pandering to design or costume about my dwarf,
everything was real, as real as the steel he had just
demonstrated.</p>
<p class="western">It is quite reassuring to a King to know that
his servants are loyal, inventive and deadly, especially, if like
now that King is facing a battle for his very survival, against an
unknown enemy of great power and with massive support from his
followers. Nailstead is exactly that, and a battle for supremacy
seems to be inevitable between us. Unlike him I have my people to
consider and save, where as he has only his own desires to pander
to.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Anyway sire, back to my story. I had just
begun to apply my little toy to the rope that supported me, when
something caught my eye. The tent over yonder, the one with the
guards into which the Spider man had entered. Its flaps parted;
both guards turned inwards with their weapons raised though not in
threat but in a warped form of salute. I also noticed that they
each took a step or two backwards and fear became evident on their
faces."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">He, my dwarf messenger fell silent before me,
the look on his face implied deep thought, tinged with something I
never thought to see, which was fear. What exited that tent I
didn't yet know, but whatever it was, it was concerning enough to
create fear even now, some days later in the dwarf, as he looked
back over the events of his tale. I felt my stomach flip flop
beneath my breast plate, my hand instinctively sought out the
reassurance of my daggers pommel. The dwarf didn't seem to notice
my growing unease; he was wrapped up in his own thoughts, reliving
his memories.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Spider man walked through between the parted
flaps. Sire, you have to understand that what I am about to tell
you is both honest and truthful, though very hard to accept, even
to me, and I was there to see it."</p>
<p class="western">I nodded, hoping to reassure him, my mouth
had gone as dry as the sand in a desert storm, my tongue felt to me
like the leather strop used to sharpen blunted blades. He was
watching me carefully, concerned I believe, that his words might
not be accepted, perhaps he was thinking that I might decide that
he had gone mad during his adventure, and so ignore his story
because of that. He was wrong, very wrong; I had a hunch, a gut
wrenching feeling of horrified understanding. I think, no believe
that I know some of what my wise dwarf was about to tell.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I was drawn to watch the spider man, I
watched as he half turned, stepping back from the entry, much like
the guards before him had stepped back. There seemed to be a
difference, for some reason the look of him had changed, he had
entered that tent a fearful though deformed human, he exited
without the aura of fear hovering over him. No Sire, as true as I
sit here before you, his fear had vanished!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The dwarf was shaking his head, his heavy
beard swinging to and fro, puzzled by what he had seen and said. I
for one was not puzzled, the creature I suspected to reside within
that tent, was equally skilled enough to incite fear or remove it
from his servants at will.</p>
<p class="western">In this case I believe that Nailstead, for
unimaginable reasons of his own had removed my dwarves, spider
man's fear. He had stepped out of that tent much changed, but that
change had been effected by the imposition of dark magic into his
psyche. Spider man from that point on would be a far more dangerous
and a less human adversary. The dark magic had changed him and at a
fundamental level. He had lost any remaining humanity, to the
dehumanized creature residing within, he was now fully a servant of
both Nailstead and the dark magic, there would be no trace of
humanity left to guide his thoughts. Only evil and blackness would
drive him onwards, and the desire to serve his master Nailstead
would be overwhelming in him. Spider man, the human was lost,
hopelessly lost, floating in a void of dark thoughts, driven
forward only by the desires of a pure and debased magic.</p>
<p class="western">My dwarf was looking pensive, the little
flesh I could see that was not covered by his thick beard had
paled, his blood had been drawn away. He shook his head and
commenced speaking again.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I saw it Sire, I saw the creature with these
two eyes. I looked upon its countenance and saw its evil
heart!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">For a second or two I had my doubts over the
dwarves tale, no one can look upon the face of Nailstead and
survive, his evil burns out the heart and mind of all that do.</p>
<p class="western">"You looked on the face of the Dark Lord,
dwarf?" Something about my tone must have alerted him to my
thoughts, because he shook his head at me.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"No Sire, not his face, he was hooded,
covered all over from the ground up, no not his face, but then I
had no need to see that, just to understand the purity of evil that
resides within that creature emanating from inside of the tent. I
had to escape, I had to free myself instantly, or face the same
fate that my spider man had faced!"</p>
<p class="western">"My blade made short work of my wrist bonds
driven as it now was by pure fear. I held tight with one arm to the
supporting pole, whilst pulling my stubby legs up to a point that
my free arm could reach the ropes. These I slashed at, my panic
fast growing in me. I sensed that the cowled figure was lifting its
head, seeking me out, eager to destroy me. The rope parted and I
let go, landing on my feet, diving for my pack and slashing at the
twin ties that's secured my cape."</p>
<p class="western">"That was when the arrow passed across my
vision, it flew true and fast towards the cowled creature. The
arrow Sire, I saw it clearly, it could only have been fired from a
true elfin bow, its distance covered and ease of flight indicated
Elfin to me. The flights were clear of colour, they would be light
and feathery if touched, its tip made of hard worked metal, folded
and refolded to a fine point, it was an arrow deserving of a good
target and one that would kill any that it hit squarely, it was
elfin Sire!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">He lifted his head, his eyes flashing,
defying me, his King, to contradict him. I couldn't, I wouldn't lie
to him, he knew that he was not the only citizen that I had
dispatched out there. He, I accepted, knew of the elves presence,
and I now knew of the connection he had hinted at previously, a
connection of need, of brother-hood in times of trouble, which now
exists between them.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf looked hesitant, he was about to
say something that he didn't want to voice.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"The figure Sire, the creature, because it
could be no man, that came out between those parted flaps, it
filled me with a feeling of pure evil driven fear, the like of
which I would have thought impossible had I not felt it for myself.
It stood up having ducked through the exit, it stood tall and
straight and black as night! It stood far taller than any man has a
right to stand, it even towered over the spider man, and he, as I
have said, was tall!"</p>
<p class="western">"The arrow Sire shocked me, I hadn't been
expecting any assistance, I had freed my cloak and was unraveling
it when I heard a scream of alert, it came from the spider man, he
had seen the flight, as it flew true toward the cowled figure. He
stepped forwards, obviously intent on taking the assault himself.
The creature Sire! The black monstrosity lifted its covered head,
bowed down until then, and with the tinniest flick of a finger it
deflected that elfin arrow in mid-flight, the spider man caught it,
whether the creature meant for him to be hit I can not say, but he
was hit!"</p>
<p class="western">"The arrow flashed through his shoulder,
piercing him fully and coming out the other side. You know the
power of an elfin bow, that spider man felt its full power; he fell
to the floor, wounded but alive. I threw my welcome cloak around my
shoulders and before it had settled comfortably into place I had
grasped my pack and run. I ran as fast as I could heading between
the burning fires, weaving around tents and creatures that were
unaware of my presence because of my encompassing cloak."</p>
<p class="western">"By now the sun had faded to twilight, soon I
would also have the cover of night to add to the protection my
cloak provided me with. I dodged men and creatures, taking care to
avoid any physical contact, because though they could not seem me,
they could feel my touch. One did, he stood around the blind side
of a wagon reliving himself, as I rushed around it seeking a place
to hide and think. My knife took him hard and fast in the chest, my
blade angled up between his ribs to seek his heart. He died
instantly in my arms, unaware that he was dead I believe. I rolled
the body beneath the wagon, knowing that it would not be long
before someone discovered him missing and a search was begun in
that area, I had to move on and change direction."</p>
<p class="western">"Behind me a ruckus sounded, the cowled
creature had vanished, the spider man, he was just being loaded
onto a litter, I saw him move, so he wasn't dead. I needed to hide
but not there. Even from his litter the spider man raised an arm,
pointing generally towards me, he was telling then where I had
gone. He had had the presence of mind even as he fell to mark my
direction of escape."</p>
<p class="western">"I needed to move, not forwards Sire, nor
much as I might want to, not towards the valley rim from which the
elfin arrow had been fired, No Sire, there was no sense in going
that way, because those soldiers that weren't hurrying in my
direction, were tearing towards that same place on the far rim of
their camp, searching for the elf that had fired at there master. I
turned away knowing that I could not help right then, but perhaps
if I remained free and the elf didn't, I might be able to offer a
return of the assistance he had given to me. I walked away,
divergent to my previous path; the cloak works better to blend into
its surroundings, if the wearer walks rather than runs the false
image remains better formed at slow speeds."</p>
<p class="western">"The collection of men and creatures, mostly
tusked guards, much tougher looking, not all exactly like the two
by the tent; Sire, screams echoed from my left as men and creatures
searched for little old me, around and around they were hunting and
failing. I strolled around empty fires now, only once did I have to
hide and that entailed me crouching down, right next to one of
those blazes, Four boars ran towards me, spilt into two groups to
round the fire, before continuing onward reunited; they raced
towards the distant noise, created by the gathered hunting force
behind me."</p>
<p class="western">"By splitting up into pairs to round the
fire, they passed within inches of my tucked up body, each group
were totally unaware of my presence. I walked on, but not before
removing a slice of thick juicy meat from the spit, hung over that
fire. I eat as I walked, wondering all the time who the elf that
had fired the arrow might be? He was obviously a skilled hunter,
because the search for him was still carrying on, I could hear the
frustration in raised voices at not discovering the assassin."</p>
<p class="western">"A flagon of wine removed from a hook fitted
to the side of a wagon, followed the meat down just nicely
Sire!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">I shook my head at him, smiling at his bare
faced cheek, but admiring it all the same, let the enemy feed you.
Don't use your own vitals. Take weapons from them, arm yourself at
their expense. Use terror of your presence as a weapon; never let
them think long enough about you to isolate your actions. Most of
all, keep them confused! All good sound military maxims, all
obviously known and understood by this wily dwarf. I just had to
ask.</p>
<p class="western">"Is their wine as good as ours?" I nodded
towards the tankard the dwarf held.</p>
<p class="western">"No Sire, it aint! Not close and not ever
going to be, says I." The voice of experience has spoken and I will
not argue with it.</p>
<p class="western">I'm not sure that I understand how you made
your escape, you said that you put your cape on and vanished!" The
dwarf nodded his head confirming that that was exactly what he had
said, but the reason behind his statement eluded me. So I asked? He
looked surprise by my question, presuming I suppose that I should
understand, but frankly I didn't. The realisation dawned, I am
human, well as far as can be told, my history being a bit blurred
in my early life and clouded is the knowledge of my actual birth or
parents.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire I! I! Well! Arr. He finally fell
silent, leaving me in no doubt as to his confusion.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Explain please; help me to understand the
impossible as it looks from where I am seated, old chap?" I
repeated.</p>
<p class="western">"Of course you don't know of my cloak! I
thought its fame in the lands was widely known, but obviously that
knowledge has passed you by. An there was I thinking that you chose
me for this trip mostly because I am master and friend of the white
crow!"</p>
<p class="western">"The what, did you say white crow?"</p>
<p class="western">"Aye Sire, the white crow! Gifted it was to
my fathers father, from the then Lord who was the mighty son of the
long past first Lord Iffilditch. Chosen beyond all by the peoples
of the elvin lands he was, in the days before mankind, but after
the raging wars between elf and dwarf, wars that had long been
settled, and left a mighty peace to rule this world." The white
crow has been handed down father to son in my family since that
time so long ago and now I am its friend and keeper."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The dwarf had slipped out of the more formal
style used for story telling into a sort of colloquial slang. The
language of the dwarves had long died out in general use, it is
said that they speak it amongst themselves in the seclusion of the
deepest of mined lands but nowhere else, less it be abused and
great harm befall the dwarf people. This slang he now spoke was
easy to understand, though coarser than high speech. The cloak had
a secret that was obvious and the dwarf had utilized its secret to
affect his escape, but I do wish he would get on with it, but
dwarves can not be hurried.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"This Sire is my cloak; this Sire is the
famed White Crow, most lauded amongst my people as a symbol of
peace everlasting between dwarf and brother elf, and for now
including mankind as well".</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">He reached around behind him removing from
his dirt encrusted pack the most beautiful white feathered cloak I
had ever seen. The feathers glistened in the light from my window,
scattering rainbows across the room. It moved, I am sure that it
moved in his hands, his fingers had been still, yet the cloak had
moved, not the dwarf moving it. Was the cloak alive?</p>
<p class="western">He, my dwarf stood up, he bowed low to me and
then with a swirl of his arm he vanished. Look as I might I could
detect nothing of his presence. Now I know for myself the secret of
his escape. A booming laugh filled the room from over to my right,
window light scattered again and before me revealed in all his
dirty glory was my dwarf, the cloak hanging twitching down his
back. The dwarf had a grin on his face which split his raggedy
beard in two, showing his heavy teeth and wrinkled right up to his
eyes.</p>
<p class="western">"Damn it" I said to him, a smile cracking my
features also. "So that's what you meant, that's how the cloak
ensured your escape."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Ay Sire, all I had to do was reach out a
little and with a deft flick of my wrist, I was gone, well as far
as my enemies could see, which I am pleased to say wasn't far
enough. Course there was the risk that one of them, say the cloaked
creature, might have penetrated my covering, but what choice did I
have. As I said, I took off at a run, dodging around everyone and
thing, the only person I encountered was the one I described and he
died silently and swift like, so I was free of them and well able
to take a good look around. What I found will not please you much,
thinks I."</p>
<p class="western">"With food in my belly, a flask of poor wine
to drink and my knife in my hand, I prowled their encampment.
Poking my beard into wagons, listening to groups chattering, as
soldiers will always chatter, picking up snippets of information
where I could. They are well provisioned Sire, even better armed,
and eager of spirit, all in all Sire, they are ready to wage all
out war on us! I realised quite quickly that I had seen more than
enough and it was high time that I returned to you whilst I still
could, to inform you and get things moving for a defense of your
realm. Because there is nowt so sure that it will be needed and
soon Sire, judging from what I saw and heard with these my own huge
ears and these eyes set into my face.."</p>
<p class="western">"With departing swiftly in mind I began to
circle the outer edges of the camp, relying on White Crow here to
keep me safe. There was one point at which I believed I was in real
danger of discovery, and that was a point that there was no option
of avoiding. I came upon a line of tents, beyond which were wooden
barricades, these demarked the outer most edge of the encampment.
There were too many guards for my liking, all dotted evenly along
that barricade. Some facing out, whilst others were facing in,
which puzzled me slightly, until I watched a pair of young bucks
approach the fence, demanding to leave. At first I thought they had
lost heart for the coming battle, which cheered me slightly, but I
was wrong! They were over eager, they wanted to leave and create
mayhem of their own, and they had the weapons to suite their intent
Sire."</p>
<p class="western">"The guards were having none of that, they
had their orders and as I watched from my concealment beneath a
wagon, one of the guards and in no uncertain terms, turned the
interlopers back. One of the two turned again, not happy with being
refused outcross to our lands. The guard then without listening,
without so much as a word to the challenger, thrust his spear
forwards, impaling the youngster on its barbed point. He twisted
the blade just so killing him instantly and sending out a clear
message to his companion and any others of a like mind to challenge
his instructions."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The dwarf demonstrated the guard's action,
thrusting an imagined spear at me and violently rotating it in the
air between us, which, I realised, would guarantee an almost
instant death for the penetrated.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Behind me a ruckus started up as a group of
creatures led to my surprise by the spider man, approached. He,
with a wave of his arm ordered the guards aside, then with another
wave he sent out a patrol, they I deducted were to scour the valley
beyond, hunting for the elf that had shot him. I stayed still
beneath the wagon, shielded from their view by my much trusted
cloak. To any that happened to glance my way I would look much as
the surroundings looked. Dark, shadowy dust covered, with nothing
else there to see."</p>
<p class="western">The body of the guard slain boar like
creature was taken away, where too, or what they did with it, I
know not Sire, but it quickly vanished. Its companion didn't react
at all, which shows exactly how different they are to us; had that
been a friend or companion of mine, I would have been saddened at
least, and probably angry at the pointless death, which the guard
had so effortlessly inflicted on my friend. It though, the creature
refused said nothing, showed nothing, and turned away as though
nothing had happened of any note, death came to easy to it for my
liking!"</p>
<p class="western">"From my point of view, I realised that I
could go no further just then, spider man remained, surrounded by
his minions, obviously he was in charge, but waiting, I supposed
for the hunters to return, and that could be hours. Well I says to
myself, if'en he can be patient, then so can I be, so I lay still
watching and waiting always looking for an opportunity to depart
unseen.</p>
<p class="western">The gate before me offered the easiest escape
route, though dangerous as well. The thought of climbing over the
picketing was just not acceptable, and even with my cloak
camouflaging me, any that looked carefully would detect the tell
tale signs of movement and then I would be caught or skewered, just
like the creature they had carried away. That didn't appeal as I am
sure you will agree, so I lay still, letting the hours pass and
deepest darkness of nightfall approach as it always does and
earlier in the mountains than down on the plains.</p>
<p class="western">"Spider man hadn't move throughout the hours
leading into that darkness. He stood facing out over the barriers,
no one, or thing approached him, No one spoke to him. Only the
light whistle of the wind and creaking of tents in the distance
disturbed the nights silence, until that is they returned. A
dispirited and failed band of warriors, no longer the eager excited
hunters; that I had watched depart through the picketed area.
Spider man watched their approach; I could just make out his skinny
figure in the flickering light of the camp fires, as he waited for
their arrival. Nothing was said, the returning bands leader shook
its head, tusked jaws shaking, casting shattered flickers of
reflected camp fire light. The band trudged dejectedly past spider
man, none daring to look directly at him, all were eager to blend
into the minions seated before them, to forget and hide from their
collective failure."</p>
<p class="western">"The guards straightened up, not sure I
thought what to expect next, they were of course not to blame, but
still I could sense a deep feeling of fear in them both. Spider man
turned, his eyes locking on mine, though not seeing me! Had he done
so, I would not have been watching his reaction to my presence,
instead I was watching him looking over towards me, perhaps he
sensed something, perhaps not, my mind has a tendency Sire, to
create possible scenarios, with little help. This I came to believe
was one such thought. I willed him to look away, to pass his gaze
from my hiding place and eventually he did so."</p>
<p class="western">"A clopping creak, pounded at the ground, a
clearly distinctive set of sounds that could only belong to one
thing, a wagon. It slowed as it approached the closed gate leading
out of the camp. Something about the wagon drew my attention, it
was different to the many that I had passed by, it was much larger,
being designed to not only carry goods, but to also provide shelter
for its driver as he plodded across the lands. Why I wondered was
this wagon departing my enemies' camp, and at night? It rode high
over the ground with its leather suspension clearly un-compressed,
the wagon was mostly empty, that much I could easily see."</p>
<p class="western">"Spider man approached the wagons step on
which sat a much hunched up figure. He looked up, raised his hand
in greeting and said something. Unfortunately I was just too far
away to hear his words, but when he turned towards the guards,
waving his hands, I saw their instant reaction. They pulled aside
the bars that formed the barrier or gate, then they stepped smartly
aside and turned inwards towards each other, weapons held
efficiently upwards, providing a salute of sorts, as the wagon
drive looked down at spider man, saying something to him, which
again I did not hear. He, my spider then walked away, to vanish
back within the encampment. Thus, I realised, this was my
opportunity, possibly it was to be my only opportunity, the gate
was open, and a distraction provided, all I needed to do was to
take advantage of it."</p>
<p class="western">"Crawling forwards, balancing speed with
smoothness of movement, I headed for the rear of the wagon. My
intent was to slip under it, grasp a tight hold somewhere beneath
and ride out of the encampment on its underbelly. Instead as I
approached, I realised that the vehicle was empty and that a sleep
area separated myself from the driver, so if I was to slip over the
tail board, curl up beneath White Crow and remain motionless, even
if the guards glance over the tail board at the contents, all they
would see would be a large, but bare space, and not me hidden with
in it."</p>
<p class="western">"The idea appealed, as it also offered a safe
passage for me through the valley with its eager young hunters, and
onwards out across the far plain. A plain I knew to be watched over
by the terrifying older versions of the young winged behemoths.
Decision taken sire, I put it into action. I crawled from beneath
my carriage hiding place and stood up very slowly allowing White
Crow to alter my appearance to match the new background before
which I was then stood.</p>
<p class="western">"A quick scan of the area showed many figures
loosely gathered around fires, or tents that were open and some
that were tightly closed, creatures, mostly I noticed, tusked with
deformities, scattered across the area, eating, drinking and
relaxing. There was no single thing in that camp but a wide
assortment of the grotesque, the mentally unstable and the pure
evil, all outcasts that had found a master to follow,"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">He looked up at me making sure that I
understood the stressing he had placed on the single word 'thing'!
I nodded, my mouth to dry to talk, as I pictured the dwarf sitting
before me, standing alone against that wagon side, surrounded by
enemies, swamped by a deep feeling of evil, which must I believe
resided in and around that encampment. I waved him on.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"The wagon was moving slowly forwards, Sire;
the twin guards had turned their attention to it, then to my best
luck and for no obvious reason they turned away again, reaching
out, they both finished clearing the opening of the gateway, ready
for the wagon to pass through. That Sire, was the right time for me
to act. Racing across the fifty or so feet that separated me from
the wagon back, would be the most dangerous dash of my life!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">I think I must have looked slightly puzzled
for a second or two, because my trusted dwarf hesitated, before
continuing.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"The danger of being seen Sire is multiplied,
because White Crow here." He flapped with his cape at me.</p>
<p class="western">"White Crow is not good at making continuous
changes, so I look a bit like a Smokey fog, being blown in the wind
if I move fast. There wasn't the time for me to make a stealthy
approach, the wagon was already nearing the guards, soon it would
have passed through the gateway and my opportunity would be gone. I
would also be stood infront of those same guards and unable to move
less they see me. So I ran for all my life, reaching the rear of
the wagon safely, a quick hop and pull and I tumbled over the
backboard. Instantly Sire I curled up making sure that I was fully
covered by the Crow, and waited, holding my breath and clutching
tight my dagger, Sire. The wagon ploughed onwards, the guards
ignored its passing completely, allowing the wagon and me through,
I had escaped the encampment, in a fashion."</p>
