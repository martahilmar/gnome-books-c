<p class="western">The wagon drove along the rough track
slightly to the side of the ploughed up pathway, created so
efficiently by the marching rock trolls, fading away some distance
infront of the dwarf. No one paid any attention toward the wagon;
no one even approached him, let alone questioned his right to be
there. He just drove on keeping as low a profile as he could,
hoping that he might pass unnoticed, for to be identified was to be
killed or worse, kept alive and questioned.</p>
<p class="western">All around creatures turned and watched as
the rock trolls passed, sometimes fear was evident on the watchers
faces, sometimes not, but the air smelt of it to the dwarf. The
creatures that comprised Nailstead's army were as terrified of the
uncontrollable rock trolls, as any soldier having to face them in
battle would and should be. The rock trolls know no fear, cowardice
is not a word in their language and defeat for them is a rare
thing, if ever it had been an experienced by them, something the
dwarf did not know of having happened.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf sat on the hard wooden bench of the
wagon occasionally flicking the reins to turn or guide the pulling
pair of oxen, but otherwise he sat and dwelled on his inability to
have saved the human from his death by torturous agony, which his
fading screams indicate had been his fate. The dwarf tried to shut
off the sounds raging in his mind, but he failed. They would haunt
his night dreams until he, like the human also passed over into
deaths embrace and the long journey into night commenced for
him.</p>
<p class="western">The rock trolls left the tented arena behind
them as did the dwarf as he slowly followed their march. They never
once looked back; they made no attempt to discover if they were
being followed. Their limited brains could not comprehend of a
threat to them taking any covert form, and as for the dwarf
following them, he could conceive of no way that he could threaten
them directly.</p>
<p class="western">All he could do was follow in their wake and
hope that they lead him somewhere near to where he wanted so
desperately to go. The King, his friend and King needed to know of
the things that he had seen, of the threats that waited hidden in
this mountainous range. The dwarf needed to get home safely, and
following the rock trolls was just one way to close the gap between
here and home, so he followed. Pulled ever forward by the oxen,
lead by the rock trolls, ignored by one and all around him,
thankfully.</p>
<p class="western">They must assume that the wagon following the
trolls was a part of some mission that the trolls were about.
Whatever they assumed the dwarf was pleased to travel in so
efficient and unchallenged a way through his enemies forces, and
lands. The wagon drove onwards now rolling into an enclosing
valley, to either side the land rose, forming into jagged fingers
of rock that extended and closed together to line and narrowed the
valley. The troll's ignored it, as did the dwarf, though his
attention now occasionally lifted from his thoughts to glance
around.</p>
<p class="western">This closing of the cliff edges formed a
bottle neck of sorts, still wide he thought, but challenging to
march the army behind him through. Nailstead would have to be
careful, and with his troops held tightly bunched as they would be,
he would have to deploy them in sections, not one charging mass, an
advantage to the King he realised. He should in theory be facing a
narrow much compressed front line, with hoards of soldiers trapped
behind it. Nailstead would be driving them hard of course,
attempting to spill his minions out onto the open plain, probably
reasoned the dwarf, driving them along the black road which offered
the best exit point into the dwarves lands.</p>
<p class="western">If the King could bottle them up on the
plain, the rear most warriors would become ineffective and possibly
clog down the battle. Rearming his troops, feeding them and dealing
with any problems would become a logistics' nightmare for the
invading Nailstead. Wagons could not pass forward whilst the roads
and valleys were swamped with marching troops. Nailstead would have
the beginnings of a rout on his hands, if his dispatching was not
very tightly controlled.</p>
<p class="western">Now, if the King could engender a bit of
confusion, he could jam up the marching army, making it vulnerable
to attack and subsequent defeat, before it even entered the
separating plain. With that thought in mind the dwarf cheered up,
perhaps the human had not died in vain, his life had not been
thrown away for no benefit, perhaps, after all the dwarf reasoned,
his death could serve a good positive purpose, and the dwarf could
absolve himself of the guilt that wracked his thoughts.</p>
<p class="western">He picked up the reins, flicking them with
the first glimmer of interest that he had shown since leaving the
human to his fate. He had a job to do, a message to deliver, and a
battle to help win. He was back to being the dwarf that his friend
the King was relying on. He wondered where the elf Iffilditch was
right then, he hoped that he and the wolf were safely making their
way towards their home, he could not know, would not know for
sometime, that the elf and wolf were hiding infront of him,
listening to the drum beats of the rock troll's, as they fast
approaching their hiding place.</p>
<p class="western">Infront of the wagon the dwarf watched as the
column made a perfectly unified right turn, ignoring another
gathered army waiting huddled together in yet another tented
encampment, one that had just been unveiled to the wagon driving
dwarf. They marched on, now directly towards a low dip or cut in
the valley side. All six rock troll's pounded towards the cut, not
slowing, or altering their pace, leaving the track and the wagon
driven dwarf facing the largest gathering of Nailstead's minions,
that he had so far encountered!</p>
<p class="western">Evil before him, evil behind him, and now,
rock troll's to his right. The way forward seemed impossible to
him. He could not drive his wagon into the encampment with any hope
of passing through, nor could he turn back, by now, he reasoned,
the sharper eyes of some of the creatures out there would have
noted the wagons steady approach. They could not have failed to see
it, because they would have been watching the approaching column of
rock troll's, so obviously reasoned the dwarf, they had seen
him.</p>
<p class="western">Turning the wagon now would be suicide; they
would react to his alteration in direction, possibly first in
confusion, but certainly in action. Guards would be dispatched to
check on 'why' and 'where' the wagon was going, what its business
might be and who was in control of it. He could not fool them with
lies, they would see through him and then all that he had learned
would have been in futility, as would the death of the human. With
limited options the dwarf did the only thing that he could sensibly
do.</p>
<p class="western">He tied the reins to the wagon seat. Pulled
out his cape and slipped away into the fading light. He went from
the wagon rolling off the bench seat to the left heading for the
far valley side. This option took him away from the rock troll's
and diagonal to the camp. He hoped to vanish into the hills and
make his way around the outer side of his enemies' encampment, and
eventually safely back to freedom his King and his home.</p>
<p class="western">The wagon would plod on pulled towards the
camp pulled by the oxen, they would of course be stopped by the
creatures on guard, the fact that the wagon would be found to be
driverless would be a puzzle, but one which had no obvious answer,
or so the dwarf hoped. He would just have to rely on the stupidity
of the troops and their orders to encamp where they were. Hopefully
they would not interpret the driverless wagon as a threat, only as
a slight mystery, one to be ignored and best forgotten. Meanwhile
he would use every woodsman's trick he had ever learnt to
camouflage his escape.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch watched as the rock troll's turned
to face into the gap in which he was lying; the course brush that
camouflaged his position would have no effect on the marching rock
trolls. If they were to remain lying where they were, then the
trolls would probably march right over them, killing them! He
reached out to the low growling wolf, pulling at its fur to get its
attention, and then carefully he crawled back and away from the
rock troll's path. The wolf growled one last time then it turned
and followed the crawling elf.</p>
<p class="western">They moved away until boulders hid their
crawl and them, then Iffilditch stood up, he needed to know what
the rock troll's intended to do, and to find out meant staying and
watching what they did and where they went. Something jogged his
memory, a story told to him as a child by an elder who had
encountered these creatures before, something useful, but seemingly
ridiculous, yet the elder had been certain of his facts.</p>
<p class="western">Trust the old knowledge, he told himself,
glancing down at the wolf, wondering if the creature could be
trusted to act as he intended.</p>
<p class="western">The floor was scattered with dead branches
and kindling, Iffilditch bent to pick up an armful of the fire
making material and then bold as he could, he strolled around the
rock, into sight. The troll's could clearly see him, but as he
expected they ignored him. The elder had said that troll's were
only capable of dealing with one thought at a time! Therefore
Iffilditch had reasoned they would ignore him if he did not impinge
on their instructions or aims. He was safe so long as he did not
attack the rock troll's, or get in their way, both of which would
be pure folly!</p>
<p class="western">He told the wolf to stay, it looked at him
with a confused expression but it had trusted the elf so far, and
it understood the meaning behind his words, so it did exactly as it
was told. In fact and to Iffilditch's surprise the wolf laid down
against the rock, watching him, whilst also watching the
approaching rock troll's.</p>
<p class="western">He banked up a fire, pretending that he was
going to light it against the cold of the fast approaching night,
but using the actions as a reason for his presence. The troll's
came on, now stomping into the gap, then, as one, they turned not
towards the elf, but away, heading up to the ridge-edge on which he
had previously overlooked his enemies encampment.</p>
<p class="western">The rock troll's climbed effortlessly, never
varying their pace whilst they were climbing. Huge rocks that would
have forced Iffilditch to veer around them, crumbled under the
weight of rock troll feet. Powdered to dust the rock gave way
whilst the rock trolls with little apparent effort reached the top;
a line of mountainous rock like flesh, driven by a simple
instruction, sent to this point. What are they going to do now
wondered the confused elf as he looked after them, watching as they
halted and sat down in silence as the drum beat had ended?</p>
<p class="western">Night closed in fast surrounding the rock
troll's, blurring their shape, mixing them with the hard stone on
which they sat. As one they had crumpled to the floor, becoming a
pile of stationary rock with nothing else to defined their
presence.</p>
<p class="western">Rock troll's are very affected by the
temperature, they functioned best in daylight, drawing heat from
the sun's rays to power their limbs, at night they rest, becoming
immovable lumps scattered where they halt. Iffilditch realised that
as they had stopped they and fallen silent and still they posed no
threat to him and also, as a given, no one would deliberately
attempt to enter up this cut, so they he and monster were safe for
the night. A deep feeling of relief flooded him as he looked down
at the half built fire, he reached into his bag removing a tinder
lighter and set the fire a blaze, hastily piling more wood on to
it, so that it would burn all the better.</p>
<p class="western">They could eat properly again that night,
purely because of the presence of the rock troll's, safe and hidden
from sight in their almost solitude. The wolf seemed to understand,
it moved up to his side as he sat down, watching the sky line blur,
hiding the resting troll's in a blanket of darkness.</p>
<p class="western">The night air gained a chill, whilst high up
above their heads the stars burned bright. With their stomachs
full, and the fire warming their bones they sat close, the wolf and
he, enjoying the comparative safety of their situation, but always
aware of the presence of the six, which were now sitting like six
large monoliths up there on the flat top crest of the rock outcrop,
silhouetted partially against the stars.</p>
<p class="western">Midnight came, the witching hour, according
to children's stories told at bed time, a time when all good Elves
are asleep, safe from the roaming of evil magic.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I was not asleep sire and nor was the wolf,
we had seen and felt the vibration of movement from above us, it
had disturbed our rest forcing us to react."</p>
<p class="western">"Looking up, I could see the slowly rising
forms of the rock troll's. They stood, not in line but side by
side, separated by an arms length from each other. The flag bearer
had left his talisman on the floor as had the drum beater. As one
they raised their arms, reaching out towards each other but not
touching. Massive creatures, performing some ancient rite or magic;
something that rock trolls are not known to do!"</p>
<p class="western">"The leader, the largest of the group as
always, lifted away from the ground. Hundreds of tonnes of rocky
looking dense flesh wafted upwards into the air. His arms being
outstretched, gave the creature the look of a very fat dumpy bird.
It did not flap like a bird; it just rose, closely followed by its
compatriots."</p>
<p class="western">"I ran, I ran hard and fast, with the wolf
running alongside of me, storming up the side of the mount, racing
to the top, I was half-way up when the last of the six lifted away
from the mount. The last pair of troll's flew after their
companions, heading out over the mountain range, which separated us
from my home land. The rock troll's were being lifted; there could
be no other reason for the strange happening. The wolf reached the
crest and vanished over it, bursting onto the flat top, I soon
followed, finding the creature growling towards the fast vanishing
troll's. Magic the word exploded in my mind, dark magic I corrected
myself as the trolls faded away from us."</p>
<p class="western">"Unable to chase them further we watched
until they vanished from sight over the mountain range. Stars lit
their path, something in the air flittered then very slowly began
to settle to the ground, the remnants of the force that had lifted
such heavy objects, I reasoned. Powerful magic was abroad this
night, I turned away looking back along the ridge line. Flitter
fell in a straight line, emanating from a far distant mountain top,
the mountain top in which was located the cave, in which the wolf
and I had hidden after saving the dwarf."</p>
<p class="western">"Nailstead I swore under my breath, it could
only be Nailstead and his dark magic. But why? What was the evil
one planning to do with six rock Troll's? The needed to escape from
this land as their fear for the future and their world's safety
increased ten fold. The flying troll's were a force that no one
could or would expect! They posed a very real threat to the victory
we hope to achieve in this up coming battle. Shaking my head, I
clicked my fingers, indicating for the wolf to follow, we had
distance to make now in what was left of this night, if we were
ever going to warn the King."</p>
<p class="western">"I ran down the hill and up the other side,
flat out, as only an Elf can run; the wolf loped at my side,
effortlessly matching my pace. We crested the rise and ran on,
always heading along the ridge edge, back the way we had walked.
Sometimes the wolf led, steering me around an obstacle, always
confident of his route, understanding I believed, where we had to
go and why. The wolf slowed weaved between two rocks, making a
right then a left turn confident as previous, which was when I
realised that he was following a trail, the same trail we had left
over the ground on our outwards journey. The wolf could track our
path faultlessly using his nose, he could I came to believe, almost
see our scent so it was that his hunting skills guided us."</p>
<p class="western">"We ran through the remaining night and on
into the morning, I trusted that he would detect any hidden enemies
and alert me to their presence. To my left and down at the bottom
of the ridge I could hear the signs of an army on the move.
Wagon-wheels ground onward heading the way we had come, more
armaments and general supplies for the encampment back there. We
ran on, finally the wolf slowed, we had covered in a short spell of
night and a morning the distance we had walked in nearly three
days. I was near to exhaustion, but knew that soon I would brake
through the lethargic feeling that was building; I would run on,
always led by the wolf."</p>
<p class="western">"He had other ideas; he halted unexpectedly;
so unexpectedly that I nearly fell over him. We had reached the
point at which we had entered onto the ridge and he was now turning
in the direction of where we had departed from the wagon and dwarf.
I called him back, thinking that now we might be able to cross the
valley, pass through any army and depart back the way I had arrived
in this god forsaken place. I crawled for the second time to the
edge and looked down. What was revealed came as quite a shock and
provided an even greater impetus for me to return to my homeland
and report to my king, if such were needed."</p>
<p class="western">"The tents were gone, replaced by soldiers
marching four abreast along the track. The column extended in
either direction as far as my eyes could see; there was still no
hope of crossing. The wolf growled, not a threatening growl but one
of encouragement, then he turned away from the edge and led me
onward, back to the valley where I had departed from the wagon. The
wolf hardly slowed as he burst out onto the plain. To my right
waited Nailstead's growing army? Straight on rose another range of
mountains, I realised, the wolf's intent, as he loped out into the
plain. I followed crossing behind him, led to safety by the cunning
of a wild animal."</p>
<p class="western">"At the far side we entered into a rocky
world of jagged edges and loose scree, turning right we slowed our
pace to a walk, caution being the watchword as we were approaching
the outer fringes of the encampment. The wolf sniffed at the ground
detecting a scent, but not reacting to it. Late I would discover
that we were now following the track of the dwarf."</p>
