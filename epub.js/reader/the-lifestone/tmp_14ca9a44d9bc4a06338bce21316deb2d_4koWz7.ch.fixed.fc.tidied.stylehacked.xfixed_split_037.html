<p class="western">With the last of the guardians passed and the
Olar now behind them, Vindec halted the donkey. Before him a crowd
of eager children surged forward, cheers arose from the adults
behind them, as the children raced towards the Olar. Each child
took from one pile or the other, a piece of black rock. Carrying it
tenderly then placing it into the gap left open as an entryway;
slowly the gap was filled, sacks of shaved wood were scattered
across the black until it had been covered fully. Adults stepped
forward, each armed with a shovel, why they had shovels Vindec
could not say, but they had! Each adult dug a spade of clean earth
from one or other of the piles and as the children closed the gap,
they shoveled the earth over the black, covering it completely.</p>
<p class="western">Soon the circle of the Olar was completed;
from that day fourth no normal person could tread the ground, only
death awaited the unwary within. Guests were actively resisted by
the protective entity of the Lifestone residing within.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec told the crowd of the threat they
faced if they tried to enter, they understood his words, accepting
them, and that day another legend was set in place. The Olar had
been ordained a place of death and none would live to challenge it
should they try to enter. As the magician talked to the gathering
the ground heaved and from it sprouted the last piece of the Olar's
defense, the gap filled with bush and thorn sealing it forever.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The granite reared mountain like, above his
head, Vindec strained his neck looking up, trying to see the place
that he had called home. The tunnel into the rock heart that led up
to the cavern had melded away. Now only a bleak wall of solid
granite greeted a visitor. High above his head the cavern that had
once looked out across the lands was no more, that portal was
vanished, melted and sealed into the stone of the mountain.</p>
<p class="western">Inside the cavern still existed, Vindec knew
that, but now there was no way that he could ever enter it again.
Vindec would need to locate a new home, one in which he could
reside as the centuries passed. He turned away and departed from
that place.</p>
<p class="western">Within the Olar, within the cavern of light
beneath the castle, basked the sleeping figures of ninety-nine
knights all dressed in full battle armour and one King, all chosen
and waiting for the call to arms. The sickness within the King's
blood progress not at all, it like their bodies was frozen. Though
when they awake the poison will also awaken and the King will
commence dying again; until he returned to rest once more.</p>
<p class="western">The Lifestone's pulses protected its charges,
whilst it also secured the walls and gates of the abyss. It would
protect all for many years to come, but in time there would be
challenges, as those held captive within the abyss fight and think
of ways to escape. When that finally happens, all will not
necessarily be lost, for safely in the Lifestone's care, are the
knights and the one true King!</p>
