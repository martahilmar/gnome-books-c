<p class="western">The King stood on a low wall, looking out
over the plain, tracing the black road with his eyes. He realised
the magnitude of their intent, the road ran for miles stretching
out all the way to the distant foot hills. It commenced at the tree
and just went on, an arrow of dark leading to an abyss. Thirty-feet
wide &amp; black as the heart of a pirate, and all of it had to be
shattered, dug out and moved, according to Vindec and his plan.</p>
<p class="western">A thousand willing volunteers lined either
side of the first five-hundred feet of the road. All understanding
that under no circumstances could they enter onto the track way,
for the black covering had been infected with evil, an evil which
still resided in the road surface. The dark one had used this road
and his residue remained latent but potent, eager to destroy any
foolish enough to enter onto it.</p>
<p class="western">The King looked out, five-hundred feet
distant from where he stood, twin rocks, massive rugged rocks, sit
sentinel like to either side of the road. Thirty-feet separated
them from each other. He knew what they had been and now he
understood what they would become. Wagons lined up nose to tail
behind the men, all empty, all low backed with low sides, all
pulled by the finest, strongest, pairs of horse or beast available.
Men held their picks and shovels ready, just waiting for the
instruction to begin to calve away at the road.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec's plan called for the lead men to
shattered the surface, then those behind gather every trace of the
black and loaded it on to the wagons, which then carry the material
away. Children formed a circle from the sentinels outwards, waiting
to place the material along a flag demarked narrow band.</p>
<p class="western">The King had questioned the choice of
children to do the work of laying out, but Vindec explained that
only the most innocent could be allowed to place the black
material. Only they would be safe to touch any of the fragments of
the road with their hands. Every other person having contact with
the material will have to do so only with their shovels or face
their own death. The roadway is the source of darkness in this
world and whilst it remains so the darkness remains. The King had
no option but accept the truth of the magicians words, but he made
arrangements for more children, and enough food and water for all.
He insisted that no child work more than one hour before being
replaced.</p>
<p class="western">The day would pass in an endless chain of
children stepping up, emptying a wagon and filling every tiny gap
of the selected land with the black stuff taken from the dark road,
before going back to their classes and play, with the promise of
the greatest feast day ever held ringing in their tiny ears. A
feast for all they were told, once the road was removed and the
first stage of the plan was completed.</p>
<p class="western">He, the King raised his fist into the air, he
took a deep breath and at the top of his voice he bellowed out a
challenge and an instruction.</p>
<p class="western">"Let the dark road fade from memory, destroy
the evil amidst us!" He lowered his arm as the first of the metal
tipped pickaxes cut deep into the surface of the black road. Within
the first hour, wagons loaded to maximum turned away from the road,
carting away their first of many loads. Children eager to be
involved reached out for the contents once the wagons arrived and
began the long job of scattering the small slabs of black
compressed road, inches deep across the narrow band of land that
Vindec had carefully marked out with flags and poles. They were
creating a barrier, one which.</p>
<p class="western">"I would only expect to stop ants at best!"
Said the King to Iffilditch as together they watched the children
scattering the small black chunks! Vindec heard the Kings concerns
and leaving a captain of works to carry out further instructions,
he walked over to the confused men.</p>
<p class="western">"That will!" He insisted "That will, would,
stop all that should not enter from entering!"</p>
<p class="western">Neither the King nor Iffilditch could
understand how, but with no option, they put their combined trust
in the magician; each for different reasons, but both gave their
support whole heartedly, there was little other choice for them.
Fedic looked on from a position ten-feet further away, he was not
so sure that the magician was all that he claimed to be, but as a
wise leader and an experienced politician, he deferred to his King
and co-councilor. Accepting gracefully that he was out voted in
every decision by the two, but he would wait and see the outcome of
so much activity expended...</p>
<p class="western">By the end of the first week of work a system
had been developed. During the morning the pick men hammered and
cut away at the road, the wagons hauled piles of black material and
deposited it at selected places by either side of the markers. Then
as the heat of the day faded columns of children, lead by their
teachers, march up to the piles, and knowing that they were needed,
they worked with a will to lay the chunks evenly between the
flags.</p>
<p class="western">From a distance, and high up, the road could
be seen to be vanishing, all trace of it removed, whilst a circle
of black began to form. Two arms reached out, one to the left, the
other to the right, stretching out to form a perfect circle. One
day soon that circle would join and the road would be gone. Twin
mounds piled high, lined the entry to the inner circle leaving only
a single gap. That gap would be left clear for a time, then once
all was completed within the circle only then would the last of the
black material be placed, closing the circle for eternity.</p>
<p class="western">A month of laboring passed, then another,
until finally the road was gone, the circle bar the gap complete.
The King who had ridden with Iffilditch down from the Elvin castle,
sat astride his milk white mare watching the figure of Vindec
walking the inner circle. Vindec walked, dragging a stick in the
dry soil behind him, whilst being followed by two oxen that were
pulling a harrow, turning over the soil to make a shallow
trench.</p>
<p class="western">Later that day men gathered together summoned
by Vindec, each armed not with weapons, but with spades. They
listened, they failed to understand the reasons for doing what they
were instructed, but accepted the instructions never the less. A
column formed up, each man in it shouldering his spade, and
marching through the thirty-feet wide entry gap into the
circle.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec placed a single flag at the center of
the circle and here the men began to dig. They marked out a square
then cleared the land; they dug down to the height of a man's
shoulder, then moved forward, narrowing the square. They dug again.
The soil lifted from within the square was carried by wagon to the
inner edge of the circle of black and piled high. The second square
deepened to shoulder height and the men closed again, and again,
digging deeper into the earth of the plain. They dug down
thirty-five feet in this tier forming manner, halting as instructed
at a square, twenty-feet on a side, and thirty-five feet below the
upper rim of the land.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec the following morning selected ten men
from the diggers; he picked the strongest generally, but also he
picked men that all had the ability to keep secrets. Though their
silence was guaranteed by other methods, it made it easier to
ensure by the selection of certain males. The rest of the men set
too, scattering the piled earth over the surface of the black
circle. The men were warned not to step on the black, once covered
the surface would be safe for them to stand on, but uncovered it
was still a real danger to them.</p>
<p class="western">All went well for many weeks, until a
forgetful human made the mistake of allowing the tip of his toe to
touch the black. Instantly his foot burned, he screamed in agony,
and only the swift action of Vindec and a surgeon he had commanded
to be ever present and watchful saved the man from a horrible
death. Though it was necessary that he lost his leg to save his
life! By the time it was removed, the leg looked charred and had
formed pustules in which black maggots grew. The man served as a
constant reminder to the other diggers, and there were no more
accidents, nor did any doubt the word of Vindec from then on, they
had all seen graphic evidence of the truth of his words and the
warnings he had issued to one and all.</p>
<p class="western">The ten men gathered in the lowest tier of
the square, Vindec stood before them holding a flag pole that he
had placed in the ground to indicate the final and deepest point of
the structure. The men and one dwarf listened, their feet shuffling
in anticipation, there was a feeling amongst them that they had
been especially chosen, and the excitement they all felt, though
contained, was palpable in the air.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec explained what he expected of them;
they nodded as one and without further instruction began digging
out the final deep pit, with its soon to be created cavern. The
hole they were to construct looked like a yard long flagon in
shape, long, straight and then forming a bulb on the far end but
with a flat floor, located at its deepest point, they cut out the
cavern! The men had dug wells, created water traps and knew their
business, they set too, and soon the ground changed as a hole-ten
feet across delved deep into the land. Vindec watched, satisfied
that they understood and then he departed, climbing the multitude
of ladders that had been placed to make access in and out of the
pit easier.</p>
<p class="western">Builders waited for him on the surface.
Masons carrying their stone shaping tools, laborers selected for
their strong backs. They crowded around the magician, eager to be
set to work. Wagons kicked up dust as they approached from the far
side of the Elvin castle; stone had been cut into manageable
blocks, then removed and shipped to this plain from the distant
quarry. Block after block loaded onto wagons arrived. They would
feed the laborers first, who then in turn would feed the masons,
they who were charged with constructing Vindec's vision. The stone
was gathered shaped and made ready prior to the work of
construction commencing.</p>
<p class="western">Normally when building a house you start with
the foundation, if there is one and work upwards. Vindec insisted
that the masons instead build a long curving wall, twenty-feet tall
and sixty-feet long; as an after thought he had them extend the
curve length another twelve-feet, bringing it to seventy-two feet
of blank wall. He then insisted that every inch of the surface be
polished smooth, and then left! No decoration, no images carved,
nothing to define it but its presence, and the shadow it cast
throughout the heat of the day.</p>
<p class="western">Next he ordered pathways and decorative
arches and then a low wall to surround the area; bit by bit Vindec
constructed the grounds of a palace, one fit for a King and a home
for magic. None of the masons understood his reasoning, and at one
time or another, many of them questioned him, but always he just
smiled at them, and after listening to their concerns, he then
instructed that they continue.</p>
<p class="western">Had it not been for the presence of the King
and the advice of Iffilditch there might have been a bigger
argument, but Iffilditch used his political skills to pacify the
masons concerns, and slowly a castle of sorts began to take shape,
built in the wrong order, but built just the same. The structure
appeared to the senior mason to be a rambling affair, with no
thought to its function. It had a large meeting hall directly
beyond the main entry, followed on by huge, well equipped kitchen,
which extended the length of the structure still more, making the
building appear long and narrow. Room's jutted left and right from
the main, its high ceilings gave it more the feel of a church,
rather than a castle to him whenever he studied the edifice.</p>
<p class="western">The roof was a work of art, it had more
timbers, pillars and reinforcement plates than any building of its
size could possibly ever require. The walls were five-feet thick,
and just to make the job harder, Vindec had insisted that it curve
around the huge hole in the ground, still being dug out by another
team of men.</p>
<p class="western">What really bothered the team leader was not
the complexity or the strangeness of Vindec's design, it was a
simple thing, he looked at the structure for the thousandth time
and still it bothered him. This castle, for want of a better word
to describe it. This castle would accommodate a large group of
people; it could swallow up bodies with ease and with space to
spare, in all respects, but one! It was the one missing aspect that
brought him face to face with the magician, his King and the King's
advisors.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire I am troubled, I think that there is a
mistake in the design!"</p>
<p class="western">Vindec smiled, so the man had finally decided
to raise his concerns, he had seen the troubled look on this master
masons face many times, but each time the man had shaken his head
and returned to work, having kept his concerns to himself. Now he
was standing before them all, his head slightly bowed, trying to
have corrected that which he believed to be wrong. Feeling, Vindec
was sure, slightly overwhelmed by the people to whom he was
talking, and particularly by the powerful magician about whom he in
essence was stating, had made a mistake!</p>
<p class="western">"Continue!" Vindec did little to help him,
this matter had to rise sometime, he just hoped that it would die
as fast as it rose, or a part of his plan would be revealed and it
was to early for such, deep thought must at all costs be
misdirected away from the only real truth.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire!" He glanced up before continuing.
"Sire the building does not work!"</p>
<p class="western">"How so good mason?" Asked the King glancing
towards the magician and seeing a slight smile etched onto his
face.</p>
<p class="western">"It can house so many people Sire, it has the
capacity to feed hundreds out of its massive kitchens, it could
even host a massive ball if required, but what it can not do Sire,
is provide for the most basic need of all guests. Sire, there are
no sleeping quarters, not one bedroom exists on the plan, let alone
the number such a building could reasonably be expected to
require!" He fell silent, his duty as he saw it done; now it was up
to them.</p>
<p class="western">"This building will never be slept in, no
living person will reside within the building so there is no need
to provide for rest places!" Vindec explained, hoping that the man
and more important to him, he hoped that the King and his advisors
would accept the simple statement. In its own way Vindec was
telling the truth, he always told the truth, it was a part of his
makeup to never lie, but the truth can be told in segments, and in
this case, that was the truth of the matter, segments only.</p>
<p class="western">The King looked at his mason, then at the
building with its single floor and massive apex roof, then he
turned to face Vindec, joining Iffilditch and 'Fedic in studying
the magician. The mason departed, dismissed by a simple wave from
the magician.</p>
<p class="western">"Is he right, have you overlooked something?"
Vindec smiled, before replying.</p>
<p class="western">"No Sire all is exactly as it needs to
be."</p>
<p class="western">The King listened, then the memory of that
voice floated into his thoughts, 'trust this magician' the voice
had demanded or was that reassured he wondered, but either way he
should act as bidden and trust in Vindec.</p>
<p class="western">"Then I will trust to your judgment and we
shall see what we shall see." Vindec nodded, his misdirection had
done exactly what was required of it.</p>
