<p class="western">"Sire, a demanding hand shook my shoulder
bringing me out of my memories. Iffilditch stood beside me shaking
my shoulder; behind me raged the battle, apparently in its last
throes. The encircled forces of Nailstead were slowly being
whittled down, my troops had closed in, tightening their
encirclement; but something was wrong. Some tiny detail made little
sense.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire look!"</p>
<p class="western">I looked, not really seeing anything at
first, but gradually by looking through the air still cluttered
with arrows, I saw a sight that struck me to the core.</p>
<p class="western">From out of the mountains, marching in neat
order there came three lines of beasts. Pennants flying, each held
high on long spears. Nailstead had managed to commit further forces
to the battle. The widest phalanx of his minions marched along the
black road directly towards me. My airborne archers turned their
attention to this column, but their attack was disturbed by the
sudden and unexpected arrival of a dark cloud of creatures. The air
above our heads was rent by the screech of madness, as the living
cloud engaged, tearing into my forces with an animal ferocity. The
twist and turns of warfare have reared their heads, Nailstead had
indeed been more cunning than I had expected.</p>
<p class="western">Still, like all good General's I over
estimated my enemy, preparing for the worst, but hoping for the
best. The time had come; I ordered a signal sent to the witch. I
had no doubt now in my mind that Nailstead had committed his
reserve forces, I just had to hope it was done with a feeling of
desperation, not with cold clear planning or intent.</p>
<p class="western">My response to his invasion was now totally
out of my hands. The final battle was set and the players in
position. My time to plot was now over; I have become superfluous
to the situation and its outcome. I had plotted and planned to this
point. Luck had been with me so far, now I had to trust that it
would remain so; a feeling of frustration flowed deep in my veins.
My sword pommel fitted into my hand as I withdrew it from its
scabbard, I was ready.</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch stood beside me facing towards the
enemy, waiting for the battle to come. If the witch failed, if her
conjuration did not contain our surging enemy, then the sword I
hold tightly in my grasp, would for the first time be coated with
the blood of my enemies. Something moved behind us, I half turn
looking between myself and Iffilditch.</p>
<p class="western">A massive creature approached. It's shaggy
head swinging, as huge paws indented the earth. It stood half as
high as myself, despite walking on four pads. It was a wolf, for a
second my heart leapt into my throat, then I realised what I was
looking at. It was the wolf, Iffilditch's wolf. I watched as the
distance between it and us shortened, behind the creature I saw an
archer grasping for an arrow. I waved my hand towards him,
indicating that he stop. I double checked that he had, his hand
still hovered near to his quiver but not reaching in, I could see
his grip tighten on his weapon but he obeyed my signal, much as I
was sure he did not wish to.</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch became aware of the approaching
creature, his hand dropped to his side fingers extending. The wolf
sidled up to him, its shaggy head lifting until Iffilditch's
fingers contacted his furry head. The wolf opened its mouth showing
for the first time the long shiny white fangs that made his kind so
dangerous. I trusted Iffilditch's judgment and for some very
strange reason I sensed that the wolf meant us no harm.</p>
<p class="western">Turning away, ignoring the disconcerting
presence; I faced forwards again, readying my mind, seeking peace
within, prior to the expectation of imminent violence. Iffilditch
seemed relaxed, gently fussing the creature that has adopted him,
waiting like myself for a development that might have us all
fighting for our lives, or might bring this battle to a final
end.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">My thoughts wandered back to that room just a
few (but long) days ago, Iffilditch sitting patiently before me
describing his sole invasion of our enemies lands. His scout had
been successful as was defined by his presence before me. I
listened as he began to talk, continuing the report of his scout,
providing me with the latest, most accurate of assessments of our
waiting enemies.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"The wolf led me out of the valley twisting
through the woodlands and heading deeper into the unknown. I didn't
feel threatened by possible ambush not with the creature before me
and scenting continually. Any creature unfortunate enough to be
hiding before us would not have the benefit of surprising the wolf,
and therefore me either."</p>
<p class="western">"The wolf led me deep into the enemies lair,
along narrow tracks, through dense woods; never slowing, always
sure of where it was going. I followed, not because I had to, but
because for some reason I understood that the creature was taking
me somewhere, somewhere important, to see something relevant. We
circled a mountain, sleeping rough with no fire for comfort. We
were too deep into enemy territory to give our position away with a
fire. Anything could be watching alert for any sign of intruders.
The wolf slept next to me, always a reassuring presence. For Two
days he led and I followed, together rounding the mountain, then he
turned towards it, climbing upwards and around still further."</p>
<p class="western">"Cresting a final hump of rock, rounding a
large pillar of stone, the valley below me lay unfurled in the
early morning mists. Tent after tent stretched as far as I could
see, creatures of all shapes and sizes materialized through the
mists. An army the like of which I have never dreamed of, was
camped below us just waiting for the order to rise up and swarm
into our lands."</p>
<p class="western">The wolf flopped down ignoring the sight that
had taken my breath away. My first instinct was to retreat, to
return here and pass on my observations. I would have done so
instantly had I not sighted a body held secured to a stake, and had
I not recognised who it was. Sire, the body as I am sure that you
know, was your dwarf! I am no fool Sire."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">I interrupted Iffilditch sharply. "I know
that, I trust you beyond all others, but you must understand that
there are many in the chambers that do not know you as well as I
do, old friend. I know that you feel betrayed, but you were not!
There was no way that I could know that you would return safely, so
what choice did I have? I sent three of my most trusted out into
Nailstead's lands, knowing the dangers they might face and the fate
they might also face if captured, but having no other option but
send them, leaving me to pray that all three would return
safely."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Saving your friend from the hostiles seemed
to be paramount, obviously I reasoned that he would not be here if
you had not ordered it so, therefore I had a choice to make, it was
near thing for the dwarf, because my second instinct was to leave
him to his fate, and return with the information. I still believe
that doing so would have been the correct thing to do. Instead Sire
I let my feelings for you sway my common sense, I decided to make a
rescue attempt but without risking capture, so no brave, death
defying invasions of the enemies camp for me, just doing something
that would give the dwarf below, something of a fighting chance, if
I could!"</p>
<p class="western">"The wolf was sitting next to me, totally
ignoring the field of canvas spread out below; it seemed content to
lay there forever if necessary. Once I decided to move, the
creature rose to its feet beside me, ready to fight and die I
believed, if the need became necessary."</p>
<p class="western">"Exactly how I was going to assist your dwarf
to escape, at that moment eluded me, but assist him I would. I led
the wolf further around the mountain finding a narrow ledge which
allowed access on to an outcrop which overlooked the camp
perfectly. Below and about four hundred yards away was the bound
dwarf. The creatures that had brought him in, and had been gathered
around him when I had first seen his plight had departed, mostly. I
thought that I could put an arrow into both guards, even
considering the distance, and I had nearly settled on doing just
that, when a slight disturbance drew my attention beyond the dwarf,
towards an evil looking tent.</p>
<p class="western">Either side of the tent were two creatures,
both looking exactly like the ones I had hunted and killed
previously. They stood upright, at attention, looking very proud,
but not overly alert. I think they felt safe standing outside of
that tent, in and amidst the hubbub of their encampment; little did
they know how easily their lives could be snatched away from them.
Perhaps I wondered, killing one of them would cause such a
disturbance that the dwarf could affect his escape. I looked back
at the bound dwarf, just then and realised that he was already in
the process of doing just that, of escaping!</p>
<p class="western">"I watched as he sliced his wrist bonds
apart. But still he remained in place by holding tight to his
supporting bar. I could see his arm muscles were now tensed; he was
apparently not quite ready to disappear. Though how he might hope
to escape through that camp I hadn't a clue, but obviously he had
some plan. I pulled an arrow from my quiver fitting it to my bow
and took aim at the left hand guard, his death would cause mayhem
to break loose and thus offer the dwarf his much needed
distraction."</p>
<p class="western">"Just as I was about to loose my shot, the
tent flaps parted and two creatures walked into the light. One
dark, tall and black cloaked, Nailstead himself I realised, hastily
I changed my target. To his side, not really drawing my attention
walked a tall gangling, sort of human looking creature. My arrow
flew straight and direct towards the Lord Nailstead's chest, with
luck I remember thinking Sire; I have perhaps just ended the threat
to our peoples. Alas, at the last second my arrow altered course,
why I am not sure, but I think Nailstead somehow detected it and
diverted it. It missed him completely, piercing instead into the
creature standing next to him. Nailstead looked up at my hiding
place, waved his cowled hand in my direction and then retired back
into his tent again, closing the flaps."</p>
<p class="western">"I looked down, the dwarf was gone, vanished
Sire, just disappeared in a puff of smoke! Where to, I did not
know, nor did I understand then how, but he was gone; just as I
should be. Arrows were splattering against the surrounding rocks,
soon one or two would hit me or the crouching wolf. We retreated,
vanishing from their sight, seeking the protection of the mountain
and the anonymity created by hiding. The wolf paced ahead as I
hurried behind, we made good time, covering the ground in a wild
exciting fleeing."</p>
<p class="western">"Creatures were clearly audible, screaming in
anger and struggling up the cliff faces behind us, the wolf charged
on, I followed, trusting to his survival instincts. From infront
but at a distance a screeching erupted, high in the air I heard yet
another distinctive sound, it was the sound of fast approaching
wing beats. We were cornered, trapped by land and air, both forward
and back. The wolf without hesitation swerved upwards, thrusting
into and through the light bushes; I followed, feeling the terror
of imminent capture flooding my actions, using that fear to thrust
myself forwards after the wolf."</p>
<p class="western">"He entered a cave at a dead run Sire,
turning in a skidding tail swishing stop that defied the eye. I
followed thinking that this was as good a place to die as any.
Below us the screeching sounds joined. Above, but now out of sight,
mighty beasts wheeled across the land. Pirouetting above the dry
dirt, driving loose particles into the air with their wing beats.
We waited, I behind the wolf; behind me the cave descended, I
looked back not eager to delve into that darkness, but I was forced
by the closeness of my enemies and the backing up of the wolf to
enter into that pitch.</p>
<p class="western">The dark swamped me; the tunnel twisted
slightly cutting off the last vestiges of light. The wolf halted
before me, crouching low, growling deeply, letting all know of his
presence. Something crossed the cave entrance, blacking out the
light, the wolf lunged forward, his deep growl turning into a
raging snarl. I pulled my bow from my shoulders, but hesitated as
the wolf halted his lunge."</p>
<p class="western">"The creature searching out there had
obviously seen the wolf, knew the beast for what it was and had
ignored it. The cave with its snarling occupant struck off from the
list of places to be searched. It was then that I realised that the
wolf had not been visible to those in the encampment, they
obviously thought him to be a wild animal, alone and occupying this
cave system! Therefore I reasoned that they would reason, that
whilst the wolf was inside of the cave, no man or elf would dare to
enter, so the assailant they were hunting had to be elsewhere. The
wolf by its cunning and understanding had provided me with a true
safe sanctuary; the creatures outside of our lair would hunt the
lands, searching for me, never knowing that they had been within
feet of me."</p>
<p class="western">"I sat down, finding an outcrop of stone, the
wolf seemed to understand, it returned as nature would dictate to a
wild animal, into the dark. Leaning against my bent knee, more pet
or friend, wanting my attention. I rubbed at its large pointing
ears, grateful again to the wild creature that had saved my life,
repeatedly, and was fast becoming a much trusted and even more
cared for companion."</p>
<p class="western">"The night passed, continually pierced by the
night shattering screeches of failure from outside, the wolf lay at
my feet as I curled up against my pack, which was placed against
the cave wall. I kept my bow next to me but trusted more to the
keen senses of my companion to alert me to any incursion of our
sanctuary. As for the dwarf Sire, at that point I could do little
but offer my best wishes for his safety and escape. We together had
combined as a single unit l and wolf, we had done all we could that
day, I slept feeling quite pleased with the outcome of the venture
so far. Now I had to return to you as a matter of priority to carry
my warning to you of our enemies' strength and intent."</p>
