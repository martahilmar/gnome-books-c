<p class="western">King Arthur, lord and master of all that
stood for good, for peace and for life, stood now before them all.
He looked to young to some of the witnesses to bare the title and
its awesome responsibility. He stepped forward bringing him closer
to the gathered. He reached out with a smile to Vindec, who as was
right had stepped to the side of the room, he alone knew the news
that the King intended to impart. Iffilditch looked puzzled, almost
frightened, not by the meeting but by the sure feeling that he
detected within his King.</p>
<p class="western">As he listened to the King speak, Vindec
found his admiration grow for the man. He with a clear controlled
voice, spoke of the evil of the battle fought, he told all there of
the Olar, the changeling marsh, created to protect the people and
the world. He told of a future where life would have changed so
much that perhaps no one presently listening would be able to
recognise their home or world any longer.</p>
<p class="western">He told them of his plan, he told them of his
call to arms, of the ninety-nine volunteers he would be choosing,
of the one hundred milk white stallions that would be required for
the long and dangerous battles ahead. He told them all that they
needed to know, all that Vindec had explained to him earlier and in
private that very morning. He did not tell them that he the King of
King's was dieing! That soon, if he remained as King his body would
rot away, as the poison within his blood had begun to spread once
more. This he did not tell them, because this was not how he wanted
to be remembered, he was and always would be the King of Kings and
those who rode with him, rode into legend and folk law.</p>
<p class="western">He called for volunteers; he demanded only
the bravest most true of his knights come to him, from which he
would make his selection. He called for horses to be provided, Milk
white and pure bred, the finest steeds in the land. Then to
everyone's surprise, he asked the people to pray for him and the
selected. He asked them to talk of their King, waiting through time
with his finest knights, always ready to Sallie out into the world,
to defend this his realm against any and all that would destroy
it.</p>
<p class="western">As he spoke, he did not know that the legend
he was creating of a brave King in waiting would spread, passing
through time and civilizations, living forever until the final Day
of Judgment. This even Vindec did not know, but it would happen,
destiny had ordained it.</p>
<p class="western">Having spoken for an hour without a break he
dismissed the room, bidding all to spread the news, to inform the
uninformed, and to gather all that he had requested, for in one
months time, as the sun rose to light the world. One month from
today, at the time of the seeding celebrations, when people
naturally gathered to bless the crop planting, he would call fourth
the volunteers, and select his chose ninety-nine knights.</p>
<p class="western">As the door opened to allow the excited
listeners out of the council chambers, word began to travel, guards
who had been listening told others that had not heard. People
rushed out talking amongst themselves, spreading the King's words;
already the legend was forming, taking root and being spread to the
world.</p>
<p class="western">The room emptied until just the King, Vindec,
Iffilditch and Fedic along with the original scribe remained. The
doors started to close when a male slipped into the room, guards
reached out whilst verbally challenging him, but the dwarf ignored
them all. One guard got to close and felt the light graze of
powerful animal teeth brush against his skin, the wolf accompanied
the dwarf and at a signal from the King the guards allowed him
through, closing the doors behind him adding two more to the
remaining gathering.</p>
<p class="western">Arthur stepped forward, reaching out to curl
his arms around the taciturn dwarf, pleased that he had arrived
back at the city. He had been sent to assist and supervise the
destruction of the enemies corpses. He had also been charged with
ensuring the security of the hills and valleys surrounding the
castle. Now he was back and the King was pleased to have his most
trusted friends around him.</p>
<p class="western">The door banged as a gloved fist knocked, and
then the door opened just enough to allow the head and one shoulder
of the King's guard to appear around it.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire, another dwarf to see you!" The guard
uttered.</p>
<p class="western">"Show him in," replied Vindec, stepping
forward to take control of the situation. The guard waited,
ignoring the magician until the King replied.</p>
<p class="western">"Show him in please."</p>
<p class="western">The guard stepped back allowing the door to
open further. A dwarf entered, having to turn side on to slip
through the narrow gap, though most present thought that he was
probably as wide in all directions so turning was rather pointless,
still he entered and the door once more closed, this time with a
finality to it which all felt.</p>
<p class="western">Everyone in the room including the lowly
scribe recognised the dwarf standing before them. His girth was
legend, his love for fine food and real dwarfish ale preceded his
person, but mostly he was known for his skill with metal and the
creation of durability combined with function and strength, and
even in some cases deadly beauty.</p>
<p class="western">He is a dwarf of considerable age, the son of
an elderly weapons maker, who like him was the son of a weapons
maker. Both longevity and skill run in his family, and he is also
the same dwarf that Vindec had visited with earlier that morning.
He stood in the room looking at his leaders, and wondering? He had
heard the fast growing legend and he knew his skill and therefore
had a fine idea of why he had been summoned. What exactly he was to
construct he did not know yet, but he soon would, so a little
patience would carry him a long way.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Vindec crossed the room towards the scribe
sitting at the only table in the room. The scribe watched, suddenly
realising that he was in the magician way, hastily he cleared the
table-top of his paraphernalia and stood aside, watching. Vindec
removed a leather tube hanging from a thick leather strapping,
which rested across his shoulders. He opened the buckle which
sealed closed the end cap, and slipped a single parchment out from
within. A bag made of course cloth, small of size but clearly solid
of content, thudded onto the table top. Vindec ignore it for
now.</p>
<p class="western">At a wave of his fingers he unfurled and
flattened the parchment displaying for all to see twin diagrams of
a sword, a very intricate sword, a sword with power glowing from
even its drawings. The dwarf examined the images, touching the
parchment, feeling the blade residing within, whilst knowing that
it fell to him to construct this fine weapon. He looked at it in
detail, noted the length, breadth, shape and design, then he nodded
more to himself than to anyone present, he glanced up at the
magician.</p>
<p class="western">He pointed towards the fighting guard, Vindec
reached out to pick up the bag he had so casually allowed to fall;
he untied its top and spilled out four tiny ruby red stones and a
slim sliver of rock with an unnatural glow to it. Iffilditch heard
the sharp intake of breath from the King standing beside him; he
studied the sliver then he looked up at the magician, and
understood. This was the stone shard that Vindec had placed in the
King's hand so may days before. Now it rested on this table for all
to see its inner life glowing.</p>
<p class="western">The King looked pale to his friend, but that
was nothing as the realisation of what the slivers presence meant.
Iffilditch understood that the King, his King, was once more dying.
The sliver was no longer protecting him from the poison, so the
King is dieing! He tried to reach out to take the sliver intending
to place it once more in the King's hand, but something stopped
him. A voice echoed in his mind.</p>
<p class="western">"None but the chosen may touch any part of my
body!"</p>
<p class="western">The voice commanded with such direct force
that even with all his will exerted, Iffilditch could not make his
fingers extend to pick up the sliver, even to save his friend. The
King touched him; a feeling of inner peace flooded through the
clearly distraught Elf. The King understood, now Iffilditch also
understood the call to duty had been sounded the prophesies had to
be enacted...</p>
<p class="western">Vindec placed the five stones back into the
bag and handed them to the stunned dwarf. He nodded, dumbstruck,
realising the challenge. The parchment rolled up tight and Vindec
placed it safely back inside of the tube, this he handed to the
dwarf craftsman. Saying.</p>
<p class="western">"None may be told of what you undertake;
never may you describe the weapon you are constructing, not now,
not ever! Your life and the lives of your future generations will
be in grave danger if any outside of your direct lineage are ever
to learn of the dwarf who made the key to the future!"</p>
<p class="western">Again the dwarf nodded. Guards entered the
chambers forming up beside and around the craftsman called by a
silent thought sent out by the magician.</p>
<p class="western">"Twenty and nine days!" The dwarf looked up
at the magician's words, then he nodded for a final time before he
departed, with his personal escort, his royal bodyguards. Leaving
the chamber to work his own brand of magic in the dwarf foundries
were he lived and worked, with a commission the like of none that
he had ever undertaken, and so little time to complete it. Twenty
and nine days, a task worthy of his talents, a challenge to be
faced and met.</p>
