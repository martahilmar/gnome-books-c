<p class="western">My life changed not instantly but shortly
after arriving at the castle. I was brought, as a young child
before a most august body of glitteringly clad men, and two women,
that I could ever have dreamed existed. Later I was to be informed
that the body of the Council of Elders existed to serve the King
and provide guidance through their wisdom to him. At that first
introduction many sat studying me; I was a usurper to some, a
rightful challenger to the ascendance of the boy king Nailstead to
others. To some I was a gift from the gods, a symbol of their
omnipotence, the hope for generations to come. To others I was a
symbol of an ancient prophase that held concealed threats and dark
portents of its own. To me I was just a boy, lost, scared, and now
with a name that I did not recognize and had not known before, a
name that I was told was mine to use or not as I chose; I took the
name and became known to all as Arthur.</p>
<p class="western">They had told me I was Arthur, they had
called my by that name and referred often to the miracle of my
arrival. Scrolls were unfurled and studied, whilst I was kept
standing before them. Next to me was the fat man, he I had learnt
was a priest, he seemed nice enough, but even he was ignoring me.
The council called him forwards; my legs hurt, I sat on the richly
covered floor, never I think having stood before, let alone sat on
such fine cloth. Someone within the Council noticed my action, a
woman I believe, she indicated towards me, others turned and
shortly I was led away and made comfortable, but not I noticed,
exactly set free to roam.</p>
<p class="western">Hours passed, the Council I later learnt
debated, then argued, then finally agreed that they were incapable
of making the decision. Another would have to be sought out, that
other would terrify me when I met her, but she would anoint me with
her approval and later grant and educate me with her wisdom. Having
been fed and cleaned up by a nice cook and an assistant maid, I was
summoned back to the council rooms. My fate had been decided or
rather had been passed for another to decide.</p>
<p class="western">The woman that had noticed my discomfort came
to me; she took me by the hand and led me away. She, and she alone
would take me to be presented to the Morganith, the witch with the
power to envisage the future. She that it is said is at least a
thousand years old, and descended from others of her kind, with
generations stretching back through time like a road to the
foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="western">We left the city with little triumph, more
like thieves in the night than a future ruler going to be anointed,
which was my understanding of what was happening to me. Then what
does a young child understand of the vagaries of political life,
let alone royal ascension and the total wielding of devastating
power. She, the council member had been selected not because she
hosted essential skills in dealing with either myself or the witch,
but because to enter into the witches presence as an outsider
required that the person be a she, which of course presents a
problem as far as I am concerned. I am not of the she breed that
may pass unchallenged; I am of the he that must never taint the
caverns that are her home and position of power.</p>
<p class="western">We traveled from the castle on foot escorted
by two heavily armed elves, once outside of the city walls we
encountered a carriage and horse team, with four outriders. Our two
companions mounted the rear of the carriage, having first
ascertained that no threat to our safety lurked within. We followed
their instruction and clambered into the vehicle which would be our
home for three long days. Horse mounted guards flanked and led us,
two rearwards two above now, with one coach man and a driver, and
the last two riding infront, clearing the way ahead.</p>
<p class="western">The dust became choking at times as the
carriage and its guards thundered along ancient climbing roads.
With every mile we closed on the snow capped peaks of the distant
mountains, not that I knew anything of our imminent arrival. I was
shut away from the passing world behind cloth blinds, with only the
uncommunicative lady for company. To a child the trip which should
have been loaded with new excitement and interesting sights to
stimulate the mind, was instead one of dull repetitive, dust choked
boredom and spent mostly in silence.</p>
<p class="western">She said little to me and did less to try to
improve our journey, throughout I felt as though she were studying
me, looking for that one flaw that would crack my body open and lay
me bare to her, I no not what she sought, but clearly she sought
something. Instead I sat musing to myself, creating stories in my
head and wondering all the time if we would soon arrive,
somewhere.</p>
<p class="western">The carriage heeled over twisting as it
turned, canting dangerously and at the sametime tipping me and her
to our right as it turned and was dragged sharply to the left.
Before I could recover the whole thing canted again, this time the
other way, she reached out, stabilizing me, then pointlessly, and a
bit late, she told me to hold on tight. I think that she had known
of the turns but was not aware that they had arrived. We felt as
though we were now fast climbing, I reached out for the window
covers only to have my hand slapped away before I could move them
aside to see anything beyond them.</p>
<p class="western">For an hour we climbed constantly upward very
steeply, the dust at least faded away; even with the blinds tightly
drawn, particles had previously gusted inside of the carriage,
adding to my discomfort. The floor was now lined with a carpeting
of mud brown dust. I could trace patterns in it with my toe if I
chose, but the look of disapproval from her soon put a stop to my
doing that, with the climbing the dust had halted its arrival
within the carriage, thus clearing the tainted air but not the
silence.</p>
<p class="western">The carriage halted, the horses blowing
loudly at the drivers puling; I could imagine the elf above leaning
backwards, straining his arms and leather harnessing as he halted
the powerful team. To my side I heard footsteps, then blindingly
the door was pulled open, revealing one of the Elvin foot soldiers.
Above me the sound of movement, coupled with a slight shaking of
the carriage, indicated that this elves companion was also
dismounting. He to appeared, checking the surroundings before we
were allowed to alight. She, the woman, my escort and guide, held
me from getting out by a gentle grip to my shoulder; I looked
around at her but realised that she had her reasons.</p>
<p class="western">Once the guards had again looked about and
were again satisfied that all appeared to be safe, then one
indicated with his hand whilst not looking at us I noticed, she
then allowed me to step down in fact she was nearly pushing me out
of the coach door. The coach dipped as my weight transferred to the
metal step, then as I reached the ground the coach rocked back,
only for the effect to be repeated as she stepped out following
me.</p>
<p class="western">I am not prone to noticing such trivial
details; perhaps the long secluded trip had affected me in some
strange way, heightening my ability to perceive, or perhaps not.
Maybe I was just so bored that even the most mundane could
entertain me and remain in my memory which ever at least the long
journey had finally arrived at an end.</p>
<p class="western">The coach had been halted on a flat hard
stone plate surrounded on three sides by rearing mountains. To my
left was nothing, or rather a long drop, falling all the way down
to the distant plains below. I could see a long way off the thin
black line of road, along which I had walked upon when leaving the
mountains beyond the distant plain. The carriage turned around
circling in preparation for departing. She took me by the hand and
turned me away from the drop leading me onward by saying to me.</p>
<p class="western">"This way child."</p>
<p class="western">I looked up at her, scared of the feel in the
air and of the place that we now stood in, scared of the fact that
the guards had backed away from us both, and the cliff faces
rearing before us. They hovered around the turned carriage as
though eager to depart. They watched as the woman led me away
towards the far end of the flat stone, towards a craggy rearing
cliff of grey granite. They and the carriages duty had been
completed now for them the time had arrived to depart.</p>
<p class="western">There was no entry, no cave, no door, nothing
that my eye could detect. Nothing which gave purpose to our walk,
yet there was something, something which generated terror as we
approached the rock, that something was beyond my understanding
though not beyond my perception. Its residue was a creeping feeling
of numbness, which slowly crawled up my legs prior to invading my
stomach filling it with fluttering wings and sickness waiting eager
to burst out of me. I halted, pulling back against her hand, not
wanting to go one step closer to the rock face; she smiled down at
me saying something. I could not hear her words; I could see her
lips moving but no sound exited her mouth.</p>
<p class="western">She looked stunned, fear blasted across her
features, she let go of my hand looking about her as though she had
lost something of great importance. The distance between us grew as
she hunted, I stood watching, calling to her, asking what was
wrong? She could not hear me, did not answer me, was not aware of
my presence! It was only then that I realised that what she sought
was not something lost, it was me that was missing; but I am hear I
screamed, trying to turn and run to her.</p>
<p class="western">My feet felt glued to the rock, my body
incapable of response, I was captive of something that I did not
understand and had not been aware of until that very second. The
woman turned around spinning in a full circle, her cloak flaying
out as she turned but clearly she was not seeing me, she was no
longer calling, her mouth had ceased to move or to question. I
watched as acceptance flicker across her face, then she walked not
towards me as I desperately hoped that she would, but away from me
back to the waiting carriage. Once she was aboard the guards
stepped up and the driver raised his whip startling the horses into
movement. They left, leaving me stuck to the rock floor, alone and
terrified wondering what was to happen to me now.</p>
<p class="western">I watched helplessly as the carriage pulled
away, a curtain flicked out and her face appeared in the window
space, looking back, I wanted to scream at her but I couldn't, I
wanted to run after her, to jump onto the running step and scramble
inside, to be safe with her again in silence, but I couldn't. All
that I could do was watch her depart, my only island of safety
vanishing down the road, up which it had carried me.</p>
<p class="western">A pressure turned me toward the rearing
cliffs something had grasped my shoulders, that same something had
freed my feet and had turned my body about against my will. I stood
in awe of the might ancient rocks, looking upwards, trying to
define the black clouds from the black rock peaks, and failing. A
push eased my body forward, there was nothing behind me, but still
I felt the push, something was guiding my steps drawing me towards
the rocks, leading me somewhere for its own reasons. I felt scared
but strangely alive as I walked reluctantly forward into the
unknown.</p>
<p class="western">Carved steps appeared in the smooth granite
before me, they had not been there when we arrived I was certain,
but they were there now. The invisible hand guided me towards them,
fear coursed into my belly once more, swamping my guts, expanding
upwards to swamp my brain. I was helpless and alone, desperate to
turn and run from the unknown, but incapable of taking such an
action. I was almost incapable of even thinking of taking such an
action, so hazy had my thought become. I walked forward in
confusion, I climbed the stairway still suffused with fear, but
always with the invisible hand guiding my step, up and up I climbed
weaving around jagged outcrops, ever upwards. Fear subsided in me
as I realised that had the entity wanted to kill me, a slight push
forwards and I would have tumbled to my death, to be crushed and
shattered there to lie forever a corpse amidst the rocks of the
distant floor.</p>
<p class="western">The stone door I remembered, did not look
like a door at all, it looked just like the rest of the rock face,
hard set and solid, yet as I approached the face it shimmered and
changed, forming steps and then into a single door, which opened
inwards as I approached closer, I was still being guided by the
invisible touch of the hand that steered me forwards. Two steps up,
and then I, a small boy passed beneath the arched ceiling, a
ceiling which would have allowed the tallest giant on Earth to
enter if he chose.</p>
<p class="western">I was overwhelmed by the aspect of all that
stone hanging above my little head. I remember that I ducked
slightly before drawing on my inner strength, it took a determined
effort for me to stand up straight an effort of mind over
everything as I forced myself to straighten up, then defiant to the
end, I strode purposefully forward beneath all that rock to face my
fate. Behind me the door closed, I didn't hear it shut; I only
became aware of its closure when the light from outside, which had
accompanied me inside, vanished completely changing every aspect of
the place I stood in. A sharp turn of my head confirmed my
position; I was trapped inside of the mountain, helpless and alone,
a child lost to all society, beyond salvation and scared to the end
of my wits.</p>
<p class="western">Light spilled from within the rocks to
replace the now missing natural daylight, I could at least see
clearly, though I was not reassured much by its presence, that
light could vanish I realised as easily as it had appeared. Turning
forwards I took yet more deep breaths and allowed the gently touch
on my spine to ease me forwards once more, guiding me further into
the cavern that awaited and awed me.</p>
<p class="western">A wooden door appeared infront of me, it too
opened inwards, but not into a cavern as I had almost expected, but
into a corridor with a very high ceiling which started high above
my head, this tunnel roof and sides closed and finally came to a
point even higher above my head, looking as though a giant sword
had been thrust into the mountain rock, cleaving a narrow but high
path through it, along which I now walked feeling much like a tiny
ant in a mighty cathedral.</p>
