<p class="western">For three weeks and two days the doctors
tried to cure the evil illness that slowly drew away the King's
life. Every pill, potion, cream, or even spell failed, just as
destiny and prophesy decreed that they should. Finally a messenger
was sent by the council to request that the witch attend to the
King, in the vague hope that her magic might prove stronger than
all of the combined skills of Elfin and Dwarf medicine
combined.</p>
<p class="western">The messenger with his summons to attend
arrived at Vindec's cavern entry on day three of the fourth week;
twenty-four days from the thrust of the blade that set these events
in motion, he was accepted this time. I took the message and sent
my reply, one that I knew as I instructed it would cause
consternation, but the prophesy had to be met and in full, and so I
sent my message.</p>
<p class="western">I was right, by return a demand for the
witches presence was delivered, the rider arrived with an escort
this time, all of whom had their weapons drawn and insisted on
speaking to the witch. They left feeling pleased with themselves,
their swords sheathed at their sides, feeling gallant and
successful. Little knowing that their challenge had been but an
aside to me, the magic which pleased them so much, had been a
tickle in the either of my power. Their desires swathed in my
thoughts changed and set upon a new path, they would not realise
how easily they had been handled until they reported back to the
Council of Elders.</p>
<p class="western">I had sent them away carrying another
message, this time they might listen, they didn't. The council is
not used to being kept waiting; I will not accuse them of being
more concerned for their might and power than for the King, but
they failed to listen, and forced me to act. I will attend to them
at the right time; they have been informed of that time and have
decided that their need is greater than mine.</p>
<p class="western">On day twenty-seven having been disturbed by
another force of riders sent from the council, I responded by
sending out a messenger that they would have to listen to. The
council meets every day, discussing matters of concern, or of
state, or just discussing. The chamber set aside for these meetings
is large, comfortable and has plenty of seating. This day there
were twenty councilors sitting comfortably discussing but one
thing, the witch. Before them the twin overly impressive doors
burst open, a dark cloud floated into the room occupying the center
of the room grasping the attention of the councilors. The doors
closed shut behind it, clanging and grating as large bolts shot
home.</p>
<p class="western">"I have come!" echoed a deep booming voice.
"I have come to inform you all that my time is precious and I will
attend on this council at the correct moment, do not invade my time
again or it will be all the worse for you all!" Some stood in
shock, confused by the apparition before them, but quickly sensing
the futility of ignoring the wraith. Others tried to reason with
it, but it only had one function and had completed that by
delivering my message, and in a way that should be clear to
all.</p>
<p class="western">The wraith smoked, then vanished, leaving a
room full of confused and slightly awed councilors, all of whom
spent the rest of that day and the next debating the unexpected
visitor and drinking wine by the barrel for their nerves. The
council has been culled into subjugation, it would listen now
having seen my power; on the appointed day the council would
understand and the future of the King and the prophesies would move
onward each to their individual destinations.</p>
<p class="western">The chosen day arrived, few knew the
significance of the day, it is day twenty-nine of a month that
normally only has twenty-eight days! It is a day which only exists
once every four years, and thus it is the only day of the year that
resists the passing of time, by stretching out its own passing and
return.</p>
<p class="western">A hundred years of this days passing is not
like other days, it is not one hundred years, no it is multiplied
it becomes four hundred years, time is stretched, magic may halve
the passing of a single day, or a year or even a life, it may
stretch time to a certain point, but this day starts the effect
before the magic, and thus a much greater passage into the future
is achieved. The day is important because the Lifestone requires
that the King be available many times longer than any mortal man
might expect to live. Still the King is dying, his health fails,
his arm is blackened by the passing of the poison; destiny closes
its open hand around the hearts and minds of the chosen.</p>
<p class="western">Destiny will buck no truck to its desire and
it will always win in the end, no matter how much kicking and
screaming those subjected to it offer.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec rested, he lay back on a small cot,
located in a small bleak room, trying not to think about the coming
day. The night hung above him, pressing down on his mind, refusing
to grant him the rest and peace he so desperately desired. The
Lifestone waited, immune to sleep, not needing rest, not able to
understand such a concept, one of not 'being,' a state of mind
which sleep grants those willing to accept it, to the stone there
is but one aim the safe passing of time, the wait to be called upon
and set free to defend the will of its master.</p>
<p class="western">With one last turn of his head Vindec
received the peace he required, the Lifestone, against its own
nature swamped out his mind, blanking the thought and the mental
connection it had with him. Deep in its existence a thought
flickered, much like a wind blown candle and it was acted upon, the
witch has made a suggestion, and the Lifestone has acted on it.</p>
<p class="western">She is gone from Vindec's world, but she will
never be passed over, as long as the Lifestone exists, and the
Lifestone will always exist, right up to the last second of this
world. Then all will be gone and the Lifestone will have fulfilled
its creator's intent. Nothing but the unending black silence will
remain, but that is destined to be far in the mists of time, and
not to be considered by the mortal or even the Lifestone.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec woke, feeling fresh, rested and
restored in a way that sleep had never before provided. A voice
whispered in his mind, flitting around the rim of his brain,
calling to him with a sirens call, one which could not be
resisted.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Come, take, come, take, show the way, come,
take, lead, fulfill, come, take, show the way."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The stone called, Vindec rose, walking
towards the source of his concern, his confusion evident to any
that could see his face, but there were none that could. The
Lifestone rests as it always rests, but it has changed. Now it has
a brilliance that should, but does not blind him. Now on the floor
before the stone of power is another. Vindec looked down, reaching
out, drawn towards him the sliver laying before the throne of life.
He picks it up, its glittering pulses of life become evident within
the chunk.</p>
<p class="western">His fingers feel each pulse but nothing else,
the sliver of the Lifestone is beyond being light, it has no weight
in his palm at all. He looks toward the slivers parent, the body of
the stone; again he feels the mind within talking. He opens his
thoughts and at last understanding fills him. The sliver must be
protected, it must be used exactly as is decreed, and Vindec
understands the meaning behind its presence.</p>
<p class="western">Today is to be the beginning; today the
Lifestone will provide the first pulse of an onward leading life;
despite the negative effect of dealing with people. The Lifestone
grants him the power to create everything that time and prophesy
demand of him. Soon the council will have gathered he knew, all
eager to meet with the witch, expecting not him, nor the news and
instruction he will deliver, instead they expect the witch to
arrive and their human King to be saved. Something that not even
Vindec with all his power can achieve, even if the Lifestone so
wished it of him, which it did not!</p>
<p class="western">The King must die that is clear; the only
thing that matters to the future is when will the King die? That
has to be the point of everything, a point which Vindec undertook
to guide from this morning on.</p>
<p class="western">The time is near arrived, Vindec looking
around then approaching the far rock wall, he opens a concealed
cupboard known only to him, from within he withdraws rolls of
parchment held protected in a leather tube. The images burned into
one of the cloth rolls surface, they will provide all the guidance
required for the first construct, the others he has fixed in his
mind, placed there through the night by the living Lifestone. It
must be protected; it must exist if the world is to continue
rotating peacefully.</p>
<p class="western">He has doubts, but they are soon quashed,
almost before they emerge. The Lifestone will not allow him such
distractions, such fears! The Lifestone intends to survive and the
deeds it demands needs and will be done, 'will be done,' and
precisely at each perfect twist in the circle of time. Vindec
realises that he is as much the puppet of the Lifestone and its
will, as are the band of future chosen, each of whom will battle on
its behalf. He understands the need, he approves of the desire and
eventually he will, like so many others submit himself to the
ultimate end, all to ensure the Lifestone's ultimate survival. Now
he stands straighter, feeling his confidence growing, he has a duty
to perform and miracles to work, he has become Vindec the magician,
chosen above all others to act for the protection of the prophesies
of light.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The council chamber is full, every chair of
office occupied, arguments fly back and forth between all that sit
rightfully on the council; except for two who occupied the top
table. Each is male and sitting in a throne of office above their
companion councilors, and placed only slightly below the King's
high throne to his right and left. They do not debate, they do not
argue, they with the wisdom of age listen and wait. Soon they know
the councilors would fall silent, their petty bickering ended once
the witch attended.</p>
<p class="western">What will happen to the King wondered
Iffilditch the senior, father of the elf, friend of the King, first
councilor of the council. He looked to his left seeing his
companion Fedic son of Fedic, master of the rolls and keeper of
innumerable secrets, is Fedric as deeply concerned as I, worried
Iffilditch the senior. They had been chose to be the balance of the
council, each has a good brain and the ability to use it, and
neither is friend to the other, but worked well when their beliefs
and the needs of the people meet together.</p>
<p class="western">Each holds a diametrically different view of
how their world should move forward. Iffilditch the senior, like
his son, is a royalist, a King's man, he believes that a King is
essential to oversea the governing of this or any world. A true
King provides a rallying point for the diversity of the people.</p>
<p class="western">Fedric does not believe that a King, true or
not, is essential to good government, and he is not a King's man,
though he is and always will be loyal to the true King. He rallies
to the course of federalization, of people ruling people, not
controlled from on high by an illusion or a figment of historical
ascension, no matter how worthy the bearer of the title of King
might be.</p>
<p class="western">Together they sit side by side, separated
only by the King's throne, though each is diametrically opposed to
the others views at a most basic political level. Each is fully
aware of the other, both were waiting for the witch to arrive and
decree their worlds fate. Will she be able to save the King and
then if she can will all return to how it should be, or will she,
like all of the other workers of health fail, and the King be
destined to die?</p>
<p class="western">Then a replacement might not be chosen if
Fedic wins the council vote, and he has been lobbying his course
hard, Iffilditch knew. The lineage is ended he argues with the
passing over of this true King. Believing such, will Fedic
challenge the reassertion of a new King to rule? Will he wondered
Iffilditch; would the people be allowed to choose a new King or
will this council vote for a creation of a government along the
lines that Fedic desires. Should they so choose, what effect will
it have on the future shape of this world, if the brake to
government is removed, and the power to decide place completely in
the hands of this political rabble before him?</p>
<p class="western">They are of course all good men elves or
dwarves, but still he could not help whenever he listened to them
screaming at each other across the council floor, in so called
debate. Help thinking that to him, they sound much like children
playing, each desiring to override the others, to select the path
of the game. Or as he sometimes described them, a rabble within
silk cloth.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Vindec departs the safety of his cavern,
leaving behind the physical entity of the Lifestone as he travels
in the blink of a human eye, to the exact center of the room called
the council chambers. The noise of debate hammers at his delicate
ears, his presence amongst them is unnoticed by all but the twin
leaders of the council. They both as one sit up more in their
respective thrones, their attention focusing on his arrival.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Human, thought Iffilditch the senior, Magic
is a foot, decided Fenic with concern.</p>
<p class="western">"Silence," echoes the much magnified voice of
Vindec, "Silence," he repeats, only once before the councilors
realised that something has changed the dynamic of the room. They
fall silent, not in obedience but in an exclamation of shock, that
their place of secrets and decisions can so easily be violated. All
looked forward, their eyes burning into the lonely looking figure
before them .</p>
<p class="western">"A human male," came an exclamation from
Vindec's right.</p>
<p class="western">"The witch has arrived," added another. Yet
another voice refuted the latter until slowly the noise level rose
again. Voice after voice layered sound without thought, upon the
walls of the chambers. Until with evident annoyance Vindec uttered
a single muttered word, and his voice exploded across the floor
thrust out by magic, demanding as before that he wanted
silence.</p>
<p class="western">His stance did not alter, his face remained
placid, in control, even as the sound generated battered against
the councilors and the walls alike. Silence fell, a blanket over
all but Vindec. He has center stage though not necessarily with
their approval. That he knows will come in time or at least he
hopes that it will.</p>
<p class="western">Behind him the huge imposing council doors
burst open, armed troops storm the room, Vindec turns, ready to
defend himself, but it is unnecessary. The troops fan out to right
and left, their captain, a man of middle years and large stature
centered the assemblage. In his hand he holds a fine blade, a sword
sharply pointed, and depicting his family honour. The tip rests not
against Vindec's throat, but certainly pointing at it. The captain
looked the intruder up and down from the tip of his toes to his
lank hair and then realisation hit him; the sword point wavered,
then fell! He did not resheath the weapon, he did not have the wits
to do such, his mind swirled in a turmoil the like of which he
could never have expected to encounter.</p>
<p class="western">"Videcaline, my son!" What do you in here?"
The captain looked up shaking his head still in shock. Videcaline
his son who has become Vindec the Magician, smiles at his father.
The feelings that once had linked him to this man are gone, swamped
out, replaced and now absent, but still Vindec recognised the good
captain, his father and felt his pain.</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch looked on watching the interplay
between the two men, wondering but remaining silent. He has found
over his many years as a councilor that silence is the precursor to
learning the thoughts of others, so silently he sits and
watches.</p>
<p class="western">"The father knows his son." Said Vindec.</p>
<p class="western">"Of course I know my son!" Replied the
captain of the guard.</p>
<p class="western">"Father that was mine, I am no longer your
son, not because I wish not to be, but because I cannot ever be, I
am changed, look and you will see."</p>
<p class="western">There was a look of horror slowly spreading
across the captain's face, he tried to lift his weapon tip from the
floor where it now rested, he might have easier thrown the council
chamber out onto the distant plains. The thin metal of the blade
felt like the weight of all things pressed it to the floor. His
hand let go, as he reached for the blade hanging from his belt,
that to refused to be lifted against this person, that had once
been his son.</p>
<p class="western">"Captain!" Iffilditch broke across the silent
room. "Captain do you know this human?"</p>
<p class="western">"Sire it is my son, but not my son!"</p>
<p class="western">Vindec turned away from his startled father,
fixing his attention onto the speaker.</p>
<p class="western">"You have awaited my arrival, now I am
here!"</p>
<p class="western">"Who the hell are you to bust into this
chamber?" Demanded Fedic leaning forward. "How dare you, get him
out captain, arrest him, lock him up, caste him into the deepest
cell and throw away the key!" Vindec smiled at the demands of the
dwarf.</p>
<p class="western">"Would you be as hasty to a guest as your
companion my lord Iffilditch?"</p>
<p class="western">The voice, Iffilditch recognised the voice!
He had only heard it once and that years ago, but once heard, the
voice of the witch could never be forgotten.</p>
<p class="western">"You are the...!"</p>
<p class="western">"No I am Vindec, the witch is no more, it is
I that will guide this chamber if it wishes to be guided!"
Iffilditch heard the words, understood their obvious meaning, but
he was also wise enough to understand the threat hidden within
them. What if this council refuses to be guided, what then would
this creature with some obvious power do?"</p>
<p class="western">"So you wish to guide the council, to usurp
its power to rule?"</p>
<p class="western">"I have no desire to rule, I have a duty to
the legends of all people to carry out, and if this chamber is not
wise enough to realise that fact then it will be cast to the weeds
and replaced!"</p>
<p class="western">"By you no doubt!"</p>
<p class="western">"Only if it were absolutely necessary, but it
will not be necessary, the fact and actions required speak for
themselves, I but carry out their will, as will this council I am
certain; once it understands the need."</p>
<p class="western">Fedic has fallen silent but he still fumes in
frustrated pride, he has demanded that the human be arrested and
still his instruction had been ignored. His anger burst, as a dam
over filled must burst, he screams at the captain, who despite his
desire to obey finds that he cannot move. To his right and then his
left a clattering falling of metal weapons echoes around the
chamber. Then to the amazement of all, the fallen weapons rise into
the air, about turning, to face their previous bearers.</p>
<p class="western">One lone spear does not turn, instead it
fly's over the shoulder of Vindec, towards the throat of Fedic, a
threat to his life that halts scant inches from his body. Fedic
thrust back, so fast had the situation changed. The tip of the
spear glistens in the light, speaking silently to him of pain and
death, he falls silent.</p>
<p class="western">"Leave us!" exclaimed Iffilditch, fully aware
of the implied threat, but ignoring the presence of the weapon
against his companion's throat. "Leave us now!" he repeats. The
captain discovers that he could move. Vindec turned to face him,
before saying.</p>
<p class="western">"Father mourn for your lost son, for he is
indeed lost to you, but do not believe that his life is over, I am
he still, but also others! I have a duty to my people to consider
over family life. I will always be here but not as your son. Be
proud of the sacrifice I have chosen for it is a great burden, and
live your life not with regret, but with joy in the family you
have".</p>
<p class="western">Vindec dismissed the guard captain, turning
around to face the council chamber once more. Most of the weapons
had returned to their owners sheaths. The threat to the soldiers
was removed, the threat to Fedic still spun before his nose. Behind
Vindec the doors closed, bolts shot of their own accord. Black
light filled the windows obliterating the sunlight that should
flood in. Torches ignited in their socket holder's, all burning
with twice or thrice their normal brightness. The room fell silent,
the air still, as Vindec stepped closer.</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch sits rigid but uncowed as Vindec
approached him, to his right the metal spear rotates held against
Fedic's throat, effectively silencing him.</p>
<p class="western">"I have come, I am here and now all will soon
be revealed!" Vindec watched looking for treachery, but sensed only
a growing despair, and a feeling of lost self within the council.
These wise men had no real idea of what they should do, or how to
do it. He stepped up to Iffilditch, noting that he did not flinch
or show any reaction to his closer presence.</p>
<p class="western">"I can see that you have arrived, I know who
you were, not necessarily who you now are, but I will not listen to
you whilst that!" Iffilditch pointed towards the threatening
spear.</p>
<p class="western">"Is threatening an honored member of this
elected council!" He sits back in his throne joining his fingers,
steep ling them whilst he waits for the next move in the game to be
played.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec glanced to his left; the spear haft
was by his head and still spinning, still thrusting against the
throat of the councilor. With his left hand he reached up plucking
the weapon from the air, then casually he tossed it backwards. The
spear tumbled, rotating three complete turns before imbedding
itself deeply into the wood face of the large doors of the chamber.
A gasp filled the room as the spear vibrated. The casual flick of
Vindec's wrist had thrust the weapon harder than most fit men could
throw.</p>
<p class="western">"I have no need of threats in this council
sire, I am not here to harm or usurp, but to guide and assist. My
apologies to you for the demonstration but at the time it seemed
important to obtain your attention!"</p>
<p class="western">Fedic slumped back in his seat, with the wind
of anger and his frustration crushed by the close rearing head of
death. He like the others took a more respectful note of the
magician standing before them, for clearly all recognise that he is
a magician.</p>
<p class="western">"We need to plan because there is much to do,
and it must be started soon before the abyss can be breached!"</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch and Fedic looked shocked, the
thought of the abyss collapsing had be the last concern on their
collective minds. A murmur of fear spread around and through the
councilors, one word echoed loud, 'collapse' one horror ran
flooding through them all. 'Nailstead set free once more,' and the
King ill possibly dying, unable to defend them.</p>
<p class="western">"Silence!" Roared the senior councilor as he
leant forward to close on the figure before him.</p>
<p class="western">"Why should such a thing happen? Are you
claiming that the abyss is not strong enough to contain all that
has been banished into it? I find that hard to accept, magician,
unless you can prove your claim! So far what you have done is
impressive, in a simple way! Certainly your materialization in this
chamber shows a talent at least for magical control, but little
else have I seen from you that confirms that I should scurry to
your wishes!"</p>
<p class="western">"You are awaiting the arrival of a she with
power, one that this council has demanded attend today, she has
not, and will not, ever arrive! I am the chosen one sent to replace
her, and to that end, and as you have demanded proof that what I
say is true, I ask you to look carefully."</p>
<p class="western">The image that was Vindec shimmered, writhing
within his body things moved, gradually before the councilors eyes,
and to their utter amazement the body of Vindec vanished all the
way up to his neck, his head remained, held up by nothing, then
another shimmer and the body of a woman began to form.</p>
<p class="western">Many in the council chambers had met or at
least seen the witch, now standing before them, they watched her
body appear, but carrying the younger head of this man. Now the
voice of the witch boomed out.</p>
<p class="western">"Listen wise men of the world, listen and
learn, for what you see here and decide this day, will forever be
the bench mark of your lives."</p>
<p class="western">The head changed becoming the witch. A gasp
filled the room, 'the witch' someone shouted, as if his companions
were not aware of the presence; then as they watched the room
swirled before them again, the witch faded away to be replaced by
Vindec,</p>
<p class="western">Vindec has moved away from the twin leaders,
returning to the center of the room. His arms are now raised as he
utters words in silence, ancient words, words with both power and
ability, words carried on the wind of his breath. Something begins
to form in the center of the room before him, and between him and
the seated councilmen. His voice calls for their attention.</p>
<p class="western">"There is one that should be amongst this
gathering, one that has by both right of birth and the needs of
prophesy to be in attendance. This one must guide the rest and he
will do so! I have summoned him into attendance!"</p>
<p class="western">The room darkened, a single patch of cloud
formed, filled out, deepened in density. An object began to form,
it was large but not huge, its shape familiar to all and seated in
it was the King. A King seated on his throne is not to be
unexpected; a King summoned with his throne is inexplicable! The
vision seated before the council, sided by the magician that
summoned him, was their King and on his throne, and in the middle
stages of his death.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec knelt before the King. "Sire I am here
to help you!"</p>
<p class="western">"I know you, don't I?" His voice sounded
older than his years.</p>
<p class="western">"Yes Sire, I am Vindec!"</p>
<p class="western">"I remember; she chose you from my
staff."</p>
<p class="western">The effort of just those few words drained
the King's face. Vindec reached for a thick but small leather
pouch, tied to his belt.</p>
<p class="western">"Take this Sire." He opened, then offered the
King the pouch, the King took it, with his last vestige of strength
he slipping his hand inside the pouch, feeling the smooth stone
that waited there for him.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"My son!" A female voice flooded his fogged
mind. "My son, I have sent this magician to you, he is to be
trusted in all things, his words are true, listen and act as he
advises and all will be well."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The voice filled his brain, he instantly
recognised it as being his mother and the witch, he listened,
feeling the mental fog fade from his mind. His body reacted to the
emanations of the pouch, his weakness faded as the sliver of the
Lifestone bonded with him, the King was back, restored to health,
restored to reigning and decision making; the stone had granted him
vigor. He reached out with his other hand placing it on to the
shoulder of Vindec and smiled in pleasure for the first time since
he had been struck down.</p>
<p class="western">All in the room watch as the defeated King
before them vanished, replaced by their Lord and Master! They watch
as he shows his approval of the magician by his royal touch. They
recognised the light of his regal presence, which shined once more
brightly in his smile, and as one they cheered. The magician had
returned their King to them! 'Praise be to the King,' voices shout,
hands slap together in peals of elated claps. Iffilditch fell
forward out of his seat to kneel beside the magician, looking
thankfully up into his King's eyes. The voice returns in the King's
thoughts,</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"This is only a reprieve, use it wisely for
it will not last, my son!"</p>

<p class="western">The King's eyes darken, only momentarily, but
it is enough for Iffilditch to notice, he glances at the magician,
his question unasked, but conveyed. The magician shook his head
very slightly, Iffilditch understands, he reached out for his
King's arm.</p>
<p class="western">The room about them tumbled into up-raw as
the King stood, all be it with assistance from both Iffilditch and
the magician. They assisted him to the center seat of the council,
the place reserved for the King when he is in attendance. He seemed
to his helpers to be gaining in both strength and stature, his
weakness fading as he closed with his chair. Iffilditch glanced
puzzled across at Vindec, who just nodded in reply. The King sat
down looking out across the room. His throne vanished before him,
clearing the floor to the council. Vindec stands before the King,
who clutched the sliver of the Lifestone tight in his palm, both
helpers understand the reason for the Kings grip; The council
finally fell silent but only when the King raised an arm seeking
their attention.</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch took his place at the King's side
as did Fedic on the other. The council waited expectantly. Vindec
turned from the King and pointing a finger towards the far door, it
opened. Standing outside the guards had formed up into an honour
guard, ready to escort the unwanted councilors from the room. The
King decreed that only the prime council shall sit on this matter!
Surprised to be dismissed but eager to spread the news that the
King had been saved, the bulk of the council stood, they as one bow
to the royal seat and walk with restraint out of the chamber.
Leaving behind them the King, his first two councilors, his two
advisors and one scribe, and of course the magician Vindec.</p>
