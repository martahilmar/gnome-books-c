<p class="western">The wolf halted by my side, it lifting its
large head slightly to look up into my eyes un-awed by my presence
clearly my being a King did not carry any weight with him. The
powerful looking and very independent Monster as Iffilditch my elf
had come to call him affectionately, totally ignored the nobility
of my royal rank. He was just a creature of the wild that was
attached to one of my own, and therefore a friend of mine as well.
The understanding burst effortlessly into my mind, from where I do
not know but it explained the presence of the wolf before me, and
imbuing a feeling of trust into me, emanating I think both from,
and for it. The wolf was welcome and I felt that it could be
trusted fully. I turned my back on my comrade and his companion the
wolf and looked out over the field of conflict.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead's tri pronged attack seemed clumsy,
yet the sheer weight of numbers contained in each phalanx, could
easily overcome the ability of my troops to resist. If it hadn't
been for the bravery and dedication of my scouts, I would have been
lulled into apathy by the apparent early defeat of Nailstead's
first shock troop barrage. The numbers involved would have
convinced me that I was facing the full force of his army, but
thanks to both the dwarf and Iffilditch beside me, I knew the
hidden truth of the situation, and had prepared my forces to defend
against it.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The King turned away from the battlefield
facing towards the mountains. The signals had been sent, the magic
unleashed, if the witch was true to what she had said, then hope
still remained, if not then all was lost and he with it.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">A cloud formed high above the mountains, an
ominous rain bearing cloud of dark aspect. Up swirling; slowly,
uncertain of its intent or meaning, I watched. Iffilditch beside me
turned to look, he had sidled up to me, we stood together, side by
side watching as the cloud formed up and expanded darkening the
ground before us. Behind us the wolf growled, a deep rumbling
growl, we both turned as one, what we witnessed froze our blood,
and forced active valiant men to fear for their future.</p>
<p class="western">All around us the daylight faded fast into
twilight, as white walls reached downwards from the sky. The clouds
eddied, swirling in then out, slowly expanding, cutting the light
down even further, forming a breeze blown box of white fluffy
cumulous. The box rose thousands of feet high, creating solid
looking walls of wispy fog. Men turned to face the arriving
weather.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead's marching force slowed first, then
panicked and scattered out across the plain. My troops held their
nerve, they had been told clearly to expect the unexpected, and
that magic would be used as it was needed. I could see the fog wall
closing on my troop's backs, swirling around their legs, eating
them up. Then from behind us the fog rolled in, I felt it touch my
legs, felt the cold clammy prickly feeling of death, brewing but
held in check.</p>
<p class="western">I glanced up, looking to my aerial troops;
they were now covered high up there by the expanse that had been
the black storm cloud. It lowered passing around my troops, leaving
them as they had been, but cold and chilled to their very bones.
Below them and the black cloud of Nailstead's winged behemoths
attempted to gain height, crashing upwards into the cloud cover
only to fall stunned from the air. They could not pass through.
Slowly the black now flat cloud lowered until it met the rearing
walls of the white wispy grey of the fog walls. A box in the air
was fully formed, the two textures melded together forming into a
grey seal, capturing all inside of the area in a smoke imprisoning
box.</p>
<p class="western">The battle seemed to me to be won right then,
but soon I found out that it was not, that I was wrong, the battle
was only slowed, the troops would still fight and deaths could not
be avoided. The plain would run with the blood of good men Dwarf
and Elves. Dark Creatures would kill those that I called my friends
and I would stand here on my wall and watch in an apathy of
helpless futility. Whilst out there the battle would shortly
recommence again, now with the first magical blow struck and soon
to be countered.</p>
<p class="western">With a flash and a bang much like a fire
cracker exploding in the air the cloud walls changed, deforming
upwards and exploding white fluffy blooms of ice-cold snow. The
weather changed, the temperature dropped and snow fell in the
thousands of tones, not on me, but out there; not on my troops but
on their enemies. The ground vanished turning from dry brown dust
to white wet snow fields in less than a minute.</p>
<p class="western">Drifts began to form up creating strange
ridges of frozen ice. Some creatures died where they stood, their
frozen bodies adding bulk to the drifts. Bodies piled by the wind,
first coated in ice, then blanketed in snow formed a land of peaks
and troughs. The enemy floundered amidst the unexpected; my troops
remained still, occupying the outer fringes of the plain, suffering
the cold touch like their enemy, but safe in the company of each
other. I watched, Iffilditch watched, and the wolf growled, as the
storm increased and the snow fell in sheets of cold blanketry.</p>
<p class="western">The world blurred before my eyes as I found
my thoughts being twisted and pulled back into my past once more.
The battle with the weather faded, to be replaced by the peace of a
room lit by beautiful sunlight, sitting before me was my friend and
trusted scout, the dwarf. It was as though nothing had happened, I
was back once more in my chambers listening to him regaling his, my
scouts, adventures to me. Whilst I listened intently trying to
understand the scope and threat of the information he was
presenting, feeling a growing fear and terrifying concern form as I
listened to him speak.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"With little choice open to me Sire, I
plodded on towards the fast expanding camp. There were no walls, no
gates and no guards this time, just tents and tents and more tents,
with creatures swarming around them. Weapons formed piles; they
littered the ground between canvases, gleaming in the light. To my
right Sire, smoke, dense black greasy smelling smoke, plumed
upwards, as hunched over, wart infested monstrosities of deformed
humans forged and hammered yet more blades into existence. Females
bound handles of leather to the cooled steel, creating grips for
warriors to hold. Younglings fitted feathers as flights to long
wooden arrows, whilst older siblings used strips of leather to
twirl into bow strings. The order, the control, the ever present
overwhelming feeling of death and destruction to come, flooded out
of that camp to greet me, and all the while my oxen pulled me
forward, beasts of burden leaning into their harnesses, dragging me
and the wagon closer to them, into that fiery version of
Hades."</p>
<p class="western">"No one or thing paid any attention to my
arrival; I wound the wagon along an existing well used path of
wheel rutted land. Many other wagons must have been driven that
way, the ruts were cut deep with hoof marks stomped repeatedly into
the ground. Tents now surrounded me, closing in, creating a feeling
of vulnerability, of a closeness of sleeping evil.</p>
<p class="western">Thousands of troops must reside in the tents,
more than thousands perhaps tens of thousands, all eager to march
and do battle and share in the spoils of their efforts!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The canvas he painted for me was filled with
detail and yet also felt as though it was somehow empty, he
continued his description his tale , his report.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I finally began to understand the confused
feeling I had felt Sire as I pierced deeper into that encamped
army. The tents stopped suddenly, revealing a large plain of
heavily occupied flat ground spread out before me, surrounded by
the canvas that I had passed through. Troops of every type and
mien, marched, fought and practiced in multiple layers of spread
out flesh, for as far as I could see Sire, and that was a long way,
a very long way Sire!"</p>
<p class="western">"Swords cut at the air, clashing together,
ringing like insane church bells on a dark prayer day. Battle calls
chilled the air as violent clashes of training exploded all about
the plain. Some creatures died on that plane before me, killed by
their training opponent's enthusiasm, yet no one or thing opposed
the deaths! They fought and fought, honing their skills to a pitch
of which I would not have believed possible, had I not seen it for
myself. Sire, I can not tell you effectively of the pent up anger,
the contained fury, in their preparation, the feeling of pure
hatred held in check, but soon to be unleashed! Sire, I saw death
on that field, I watched the fires of coming annihilation being
stoked; and I still had to pass thorough it all to make my escape
back to inform you Sire."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The look of fear in the dwarf was something
that I had never expected to see! I listened hard, mulling over his
words, realising that I faced not one army, but two! Both well
drilled, armed and constructed, both imbued with a desire to
destroy all that I held in esteem. My people would be called upon
to fight and against a ferocity unheard of they would be tested in
the coming battles. I wondered would they prove strong enough to
resist and win, or would they collapse and perish to be crush
beneath dark feet and a darker will.</p>
<p class="western">For the first time in my life I felt a wave
of futility pass over me, of being out of my depth, of being unable
to cope with the coming events. Gasping a sharp breath in, I
banished the loathed self doubt that had begun to take control of
my feelings. I grabbed a tight hold of my destiny, taking a mental
hold of the fact that I was, and am, and always would be the True
King. I clutched my belief to my breast, the belief that I would
prevail; holding onto it as a talisman to the future.</p>
<p class="western">Thoughts locked in the darker places of my
mind were banished by my upwelling belief; a little voice still
remained to hum out a ditty of destruction to come. I banished it,
turning my attention back to the dwarf, and waved lightly with my
hand against the air for him to continue, I needed to know the
worst, so that I might plan for it in the hope of winning out and
becoming that which the legends claim I am.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf had noted my decent into thought
and had fallen silent, allowing me to construct a picture of his
tale in my thoughts. When I indicated, he continued with his
revelations, adding to the burgeoning fear for my people's future,
a fear he had already created not one that he had constructed, that
honour fell to Nailstead.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"The track led to my right, pirouetting
around the training fields, my oxen followed the rutting as though
they, unlike me, knew the way. I rounded the soldiers and tried to
ignore them as my mind attempted to accept the reality of the
sights I was encountering. Infront of me began a series of larger
tents, all facing away from me; so I could not see inside of them;
my wagon closed."</p>
<p class="western">"I passed looking unconcerned between twin
towering walls of canvas, always following the rutted road wherever
it led. Before me, spread out and open there was a circular area
filled with tables, at which thousands of Nailstead's minions were
sitting eating foods prepared in the tents. This was clearly a
feeding area; the troops I had passed practicing their skills were
only a small part of the mighty army of the dark one. Before me,
spread out like an unfurled carpet was another section of that
army, a section which out numbered those that I had just passed
bye?"</p>
<p class="western">"The question was and still is Sire, how many
other such areas are there still unseen by me, residing in and
around that camp? Was this the only other camp or were there three
or even four in total? The thought terrified me, I pushed it to the
deep recesses of my mind, I could only investigate to my best
ability and return home to report in one piece, if at all
possible."</p>
<p class="western">"Beyond them Sire roared a fire, and infront
of that fire was a cross of wood upon which was strapped, choking
his life away, was a human, one of our people. He was providing
entertainment for a multitude of creatures laying about the fire
area. His coughs echoed out his misery and suffering as the smoke
wafted towards his bound figure. The creatures did not seem to be
questioning him; they just seemed to be enjoying watching him
suffer, as I said Sire, he was naught more than entertainment to
them!"</p>
<p class="western">"Boom, the sound drowned out the coughing of
the human as well as the taunting of his captives. Even the
constant drone of conversation and the buzz of arguments, which
flooded the camp creating a background noise, fell silent."</p>
<p class="western">"Boom boom, it rang out again, punching
through the air, pounding against my ears; startling my oxen,
causing them to try to run in fear of the approaching. Only the
fact that they were tethered, harnessed together and I was pulling
back hard against their reins, which thankfully were fitted to
metal rings in their nostrils, steadied my frightened animals.</p>
<p class="western">Boom, boom, the sound repeated, then it
settled into a steady ear bashing beat, indicating that something
more terrifying than the creatures I had already encountered was
fast approached the camp. All around me Nailstead's minions stood,
turning almost as one towards the new sound; parting to create a
pathway through their midst."</p>
<p class="western">"Six of them marched between the canvas, one
tent was just a tad to close to another to let then pass, it fell,
collapsed like so much sheeting, metal poles twisted effortlessly
beneath the touch of the approaching creatures. Boom rang the drum
beat announcing for all to hear, that they had arrived. The Rock
Troll's had entered into the coming fray; the rock trolls exist, I
realised looking at them marching into the camp. I had heard of
these fearsome creatures through stories told at my father's knee,
designed, I have always believed to scare young dwarves towards
better behaviors. Now they had arrived, I watched only six of them,
but that six made the rest of Nailstead's army look puny."</p>
<p class="western">"To describe a rock troll Sire is to attempt
to describe a mountain that moves. They are huge, not tall in the
normal sense of things, but massive beyond compare. They are wide
and covered in flat slabs of muscular floating rock. Their heads
are rough edged boulders, dropped haphazardly on to massive black
rock shoulders. They look forward through twin eyes, but how they
can see past the pointed jagged shards of granite that protrude
from their faces is unfathomable to me, but clearly they can. Arms
swing from those shoulders, arms as thick as my oxen's backs, arms
that drag almost to the floor, with huge three fingered hands
attached to their ends."</p>
<p class="western">"Boom boom, sounded the drum, held
effortlessly beneath an arm and trapped against the solid flesh of
the creature's body. Boom, the troll beat at the drum with a pole
of wood, topped in course cloth. Boom boom, sounded their closing
symphony, I geed-up my oxen by flicking the reins against their
backs, needing to move the wagon from the track onto which the
column of six had turned. Boom boom, they closed marching in pairs,
filling the track, shaking the ground with their tread. Creatures
of all kinds turned to face the party as it passed unconcerned or
interested, through the camp."</p>
<p class="western">"They looked ahead ignoring anyone, or
anything that was not directly in their way. The drum beat a march,
slow, but constant, ever forwards. I got the clear feeling that
they would march like that forever if nothing stopped them, forcing
their way through any and all resistance. How Sire we are going to
halt them if they march out onto our plain I have no idea, but if
this coming battle is to be won, then they must be stopped!"</p>
<p class="western">"With my wagon turned off the track and the
oxen tightly reined in I watched as the trolls marched past,
leaving behind deep indentations into the dry hard ground with
every step that they took. I glanced up and across the track-way,
the human was still secured, but his head had lifted enough to see
the passing of the trolls. Our eyes met and recognition flared
within me. I knew the man, I even liked him and much respected his
abilities, how had he arrived at this point to become a captive and
to be made to suffer for the entertainment of our enemies I did not
know.</p>
<p class="western">My first thought Sire was that I would have
to save him, much as Iffilditch had saved me, but unlike that
situation there was little hope of my being able to do anything
that would save the man. He was surrounded by them, and once the
trolls had marched past, they would again return their collective
attention towards him."</p>
<p class="western">"I had been lucky when I was a captive as
they wanted to interrogate me, so I had not been tortured, only
guarded, and not very well at that, so my escape was possible. This
man was doomed, there was no possible approach for me to him, no
way to release his bonds without being instantly seen and killed,
or worse captured. I had no wish to join him in being roasted and
smoked alive; I had a duty to you Sire first and foremost. I made
my decision, the hardest decision of my life, but I made it. I
turned my head away and picked up the oxen's reins, and with a
click and a slap of leather, I departed that place. Leaving him,
the human, possibly I think, your third scout, to face his untimely
death."</p>
<p class="western">"Leaving that place meant turning my wagon
back onto the track, and that meant following the slow methodical
drum beat of the marching rock trolls as they led me through the
camp. There was an advantage to me to follow them, they effectively
cleared the path before me of anyone or anything. Creatures darted
from the track as they approached, vanishing swiftly leaving a
clear path for me to follow."</p>
<p class="western">"From behind I heard a piercing scream, a
glance back only added to my discomfort at leaving a compatriot in
arms. Creatures were milling around the bound figure, I watched,
fascinated, trusting the oxen to follow the path taking me away
from the horror of the scene behind me."</p>
<p class="western">"A group of man like things had formed up
around the choking body of the human and piecemeal they were
cutting him apart, pealing skin from his body with metal hooks,
laughing at his agony. He was still alive and very aware, his pain
echoed across the plain pounding hard against my ears as I
departed. Scream followed scream, as his agony increased. Soon I
hoped he would be dead and freed from his suffering, but not soon
enough for me or him."</p>
<p class="western">"The trolls marched onwards, I followed,
putting distance between me and the screams; though I could never
put enough distance for them not to haunt my memory Sire. I will
lie awake many a night from now on always wondering if there had
not been something I could have done, some little action that might
have ended his slow death just that much quicker. I tell myself
that there was nothing, nothing at all that I could have done for
him, but the doubt still lingers, as does the sounds of his slow
agonizing and pointless death.</p>
<p class="western">"</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf looked up at me as I watched his
agony flitter quite evidently across his face. We both believed
that we knew who had been responsible for sending the man out to
meet his fate. I looked at him, silenced by the tale he had told
me, unable to put my thoughts into words, feeling his pain whilst
wishing that I could have done something else other than send that
brave man out to meet such a terrible death. I had taken the
decision to send out three scouts and one of them was now sitting
before me, haunted by his encounter with another.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Sire he died bravely, his achievements
should be recognised, his sacrifices honored, but most of all Sire,
most of all the creatures that did this to him should die!"</p>
<p class="western">The anger in my dwarf's voice filled the
room; much like the drum beats of the trolls had filled the
plain.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Sire there can be no mercy for the likes of
them, no peace in death, and no hope for a future, we have to
eliminate them completely!"</p>
<p class="western">He was right of course, I would have to
eliminate them completely, but the question is could I, would I be
able to destroy the destroyers of life, could I murder my boy hood
friend in cold blood if I got my hands on him, or would it be my
body that rotted away after the coming battle?</p>
<p class="western">I nodded to the dwarf, wanting to put my arm
around his shoulder, to offer him some reassurance that he had
acted wisely, all the while knowing that he would not accept or
want that reassurance. He is wise enough in the ways of the world
to know that he made the right decision, he would understand though
not accept that one death is a little price to pay for the
information that he has returned with. Still a man, a good man had
died, how many others would follow him to the grave, how many
others would die before this battle finally ends?"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"What of the elf? What happened to
Iffilditch, do you know?" I felt fear and concern blooming in my
chest?</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I do not know Sire, he and the wolf
vanished! Much as I have already told you, I never saw them again;
I can only hope that they will return safely.</p>
