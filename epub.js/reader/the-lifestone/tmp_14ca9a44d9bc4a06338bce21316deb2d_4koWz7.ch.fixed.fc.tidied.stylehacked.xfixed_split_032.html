<p class="western">Vindec stood alone in the dark, his only
company the empty back of a flat wagon. He waited until the time
arrived and then his hand reached out to touch the wood of the
wagon.</p>
<p class="western">In the cavern that Vindec called home, a
strange light filtered and brightened in a snaking column, inches
wide, but extending in its length with every passing second. The
entity of the Lifestone reached out across the floor, stretching
out, seeking an exact point. The room faded as the light departed,
only the dull glow of the light snake lit the cavern now, but in
the passage off the cavern, the light burned intensely bright. The
point was selected and the light delved between and through the
solid floor, altering the granite structure to allow it to
pass.</p>
<p class="western">Below near the front of the cavern a split
occurred, one tongue pulled away from the snake light, departing
outwards towards the dark night, molding and reshaping the rocks as
it flowed. The original tongue carried on, worming through the
granite until the rock itself changed, becoming no longer rock, but
water, frozen solid water. The light entered reaching into the ice,
seeking the center of the room where it expanded, filling out the
cave.</p>
<p class="western">Ice did not melt with the invasion, but
mental resistance and control by another faded from the four
entombed figures. The rock trolls felt the light enter their lives,
felt the power that flooded through their minds, and accepted it as
being right. Soon the ice melted, soon the rock trolls captured by
a magician, sent to destroy the Lifestone and to kill the witch, by
the dark one were freed, both from the ice, and the control of
Nailstead.</p>
<p class="western">The trolls moved, stood up, turned, and felt
life again; their strength was now in demand and their service to
the stone essential; for magic could not be used to move the stone!
Magic cast at the Lifestone would be repelled, driven into the
person delivering the magic, thus the Lifestone protects
itself.</p>
<p class="western">This cavern which is currently its home could
only be temporary. Out there waited its real home; a place of
safety for it to reside, somewhere created to and destined to
protect its entity, throughout the passage of time. The Lifestone
calls and all obey.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec did not notice the passing of time or
the relocation of both him and the wagon. He appeared at the base
of the granite mountain, facing four huge powerful rock trolls.
They lowered their collective heads as the air shimmered revealing
him to them. Surprise, shock, even questions are not in the
vocabulary of thought of the rock trolls.</p>
<p class="western">Whatever happens, they accept, without
question or interest. Their only real emotion is confusion, and
then only when they do not have a way forward or have to make a
decision. Usually they sit waiting for someone or something to
decide for them, then they move, rock steady, unstoppable by any
normal means. They have no understanding of where they are, or how
they got there, nor do they have any interest in understanding,
they have a job to do, a way to move forward and a voice to listen
too.</p>
<p class="western">Only two of the trolls would be needed for
what must be done, the other pair would remain by the wagon, they
would stay for as long as it is required of them, time had no
meaning to them. The chosen pair stand, behind them Vindec can see
the new entrance to his home; gone are the steps and narrow
passages, which led the invited through the granite walls, replaced
now by a slope, one wide enough for a rock troll to walk through.
They enter, Vindec leading, they followed him up the slope, which
gently sweeps left as it climbs until it enters into the cavern
room. The tunnel leading to Vindec's room is gone, replaced by a
solid wall, his meager belongings now sealed away for all time.</p>
<p class="western">The crystal waits, he can hear it calling
softly to his thoughts, demanding gently, that now is the time! The
trolls hear nothing, but follow as they should. Vindec knows that
it would appear to be far easier to use magic to relocate the
Lifestone to its new home, but that to try to do so would be the
death of him, the stone and magic can never mix. They will repel
each other and destroy the user, before the Lifestone submits to
any such spell; which left Vindec with only one option that of
muscle and walking, coupled with carrying, as the only way to
relocate the glowing power.</p>
<p class="western">Though Vindec could and had touched the
surface of the stone, the rock trolls could not; it would be
instant death for them if they tried. A cradle rested on twin
supports, created by the Lifestone in readiness for this day.
Vindec approached the stone, lowered his head, communing with the
entity within. She soothes his mind, assures him that all will be
well, and so Vindec bends, wrapping his arms around and beneath the
glowing stone, he lifts it.</p>
<p class="western">He feels the weight compressing his bones, it
is heavy to lift alone, but equally he knows that he can do so. He
swivels, shuffling his feet around until with genuine relief he
lowers the stone into its waiting cradle. His physical part in
re-homing the Lifestone is now complete. The rock trolls approach,
one to the front one to the rear. Massive arms, capped by dense
huge fingers close around the twin carrying bars, they stand,
lifting the weight as though it was nothing. To them it is as
nothing, just a little something they need to carry for a
while.</p>
<p class="western">Lead by Vindec they depart the cavern;
shortly the Lifestone and its cradle were secreted hidden from
mortal sight within the back of the wagon. Two trolls stood by the
back board, whilst the other pair took up the position normally
occupied by the horse team. Vindec sits in the driver's seat. They
move, the trolls behind leant forwards pushing the wagon on, whilst
the rock troll horses pull the wagon onwards. Vindec sits in
silence, watching the massive backs flex as footstep follows
footstep, pace after pace. The wagon travels not especially
quickly, but constant and unstoppable, towards the ring of black
and the well of the Lifestone, all that he has seen created is in
waiting, and soon all will be in its correct position.</p>
<p class="western">The trip passed in silence with not even the
sound of the wagons wheels turning, grating against their hubs
filtered up to Vindec, they were seen by no one, heard by no one.
Despite their passing close to settlements, through a village, and
between two drunks that were verbally abusing each other across the
width of the road on which they traveled.</p>
<p class="western">Magic could not be used against the Lifestone
but it could be cast around the presence and Vindec, sitting in
silence in the driver's seat, he was holding a balloon of nothing
tight to the passing vehicle. None would know of this nights work,
none would suspect the power being moved through the land. Not even
Nailstead a prisoner in the abyss would know of the relocation of
the Lifestone at least not until it was safely ensconced in its new
home.</p>
<p class="western">Dawn closed on the party as it closed on the
black circle. Soon they passed between twin rocks, rocks that had
previously guarded the black road but which had like their
companions come back to life and had during the long night moved to
a new place, sitting once more, twin giant pinnacles of stone there
to wait. Nothing moved as the wagon and its cargo entered into the
circle, the rocks remained rocks, knowing that what passed them by
was as it should be. They, the rock troll sentinels would only
react to invasion by those not permitted within the circle but
nothing else would stir them from their rest.</p>
<p class="western">They sit forever silent, allowing time and
weeds to form and vanish, sometimes coating them in green at other
time dying back revealing them fully. Vindec steered the troll's
inwards, deeper and towards the main structure. Once at the entry
to the long hall he halted the wagon, Then he climbed down to
supervise the final installation. The Lifestone had finally arrived
and soon it would be sealed inside of its new home, alone for now,
but soon to be accompanied through time by the chosen.</p>
<p class="western">Two trolls plucked the stone from the wagon,
led by Vindec they enter into the hall passing through the doors
which open to greet them, and closed behind them, hiding them from
any prying eyes. Darkness surrounds the three but the light of the
Lifestone grew, illuminating the room in all of its austerity.
Vindec stopped, he looked forward, he pointed a single finger at
the floor. The room fell even more silent, the ground before him
noted their entry, noted his indication, and obeyed his
instruction, welcoming all to its presence.</p>
<p class="western">Before them appeared an arch, beyond it a
tunnel waited. Vindec led the trolls through the arch and into the
tunnel then down. They followed the curving gently sloping path to
a solid brick wall, there once again Vindec accompanied by a
blinding flash of light from the crystal pointed at the brick
barrier. An arch, the second of their journey formed, they again
passed beneath its towering curves entering into the sealed room
beyond, a room created by the builders who knew nothing of its use,
believing it to be empty and sealed forever.</p>
<p class="western">He looked across the space lit solely by the
Lifestone, seeing the bricks which seal the only known entry point
into this cavern. The rock trolls stepped forward placing the
support they have delivered directly in the center of the cavern,
then together they turn away, their duty fulfilled, they depart,
soon to be followed by Vindec. Behind Vindec the archways vanish as
he passed through it for the last time, walls melded together
sealing the Lifestone in to its permanent resting place. From this
day forwards only the selected could enter into the Lifestone's
presence there to bathe for a time in its rich glow.</p>
<p class="western">The last arch closed, one of the trolls had
sat down, neatly placed before the concealed entry, there to remain
as a last or first guardian of the Lifestone. Only dust falling to
the floor disturbed by their passing, it filtered down coating the
silent rock guardian, it was now the only indicator as to what had
taken place. Inside silence remained, below ground hidden from
sight, the Lifestone lived. It reached out and secured the abyss,
holding all that should be within, captive, as it would for many
years to come.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec stands before the three remaining rock
trolls, his eyes studying them as the sun rose lighting the inner
circle. Sunlight covered the stone muscles, his magic added to the
mix and the trolls changed, not instantly, more melting away, being
replaced by something new, something equally as dangerous but far
more capable than a rock troll. Vindec nodded to himself as three
mounted knights stood before him.</p>
<p class="western">"Welcome keepers of the paths!"</p>
<p class="western">Of the three only one showed signs of
recognition, it also is the only one of the keepers that is gifted
with speech.</p>
<p class="western">"You are the magician Vindec, you are here
and accepted!" The keeper turned his horse and rode out to fulfill
his duty, to keep forever the paths.</p>
