<p class="western">My troops formed up ready, others arrived
from behind summoned from their hiding place by my officers, many
appeared to both the right and left of me. We were ready, our
numbers less than the force we faced, but trenches were dug and
traps prepared. Now is the time for me to fall back and join my
men, I to need to be ready to repel our mounting enemy. I turn once
more looking towards the mountain home of the witch. Wondering if
she would let us down, the same thought had flitted through my mind
a hundred times, each with no answer in response, would she?</p>
<p class="western">I lead Iffilditch across the rough ground
towards the black road and back to where it had all started for me.
I intended to command from the very end of the black road, in the
place that I had first been discovered as a boy, long years ago to
my memory. More troops appeared from hiding all around us, taking
up battle places along a natural ridge, hiding behind stone walls,
spears poking forwards, butts driven into the earth to resist any
charge; each preparing himself to face the rage of the battle to
come. Hundreds, no a thousand, no more of them, all waiting, all
fighting their own fears as out there, Nailstead's army swirled and
expanded slowly building its strength. Each eager to over throw our
resistance and claim the spoils of war from my people.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf had been right, we had to contain
them on the open ground, we must destroy them where they stand, no
matter how many creatures face us. If we can effectively contain
them out there, then the remaining forces will become stacked up
behind them, and they would be trapped ineffectually in the valley
beyond. Over there I knew, and my troops knew, are thousands of
desperate foes, all eager to join with us in battle, desperate to
crush us, and all that stands before them, is us. In comparison to
them we number only a few, but a dedicated few, driven by the need
to survive, to save our lives from total annihilation. I salute my
troops, receiving a cheer of good will and faith in me back from
them. All is ready, except for the witch! I have seen nothing other
than the first, the opening thrust of weather by her magic. Now
like every soul defending the plain, I have to place my trust in
her and the power of the stone that she wields.</p>
<p class="western">The tree I had studied as a child stood alone
and proud, reaching out to encompass our world, I imagined it as
being the last barrier, its arms stretched out from a withering
thorn encrusted trunk, defying the enemy access into our lands by
its presence.</p>
<p class="western">The closer I walked to the point of no
return, the stranger my head began to feel, my headache seemed to
be back and with a vengeance, my thoughts clouded over, tearing me
away from the battle, back to somewhere I did not want to go. I
stumbled, clumsily tripping over something unseen, Strong Elvin
arms encircled my waist pulling me upright again, I half turned
trying to smile, feeling as though I was falling again. With the
help of those arms I was vaguely aware of being sat down, a voice
talking to me through the fog of my thoughts, I tried to answer it,
but the just fog gusted thicker, damping out the words, removing
any conscious understanding of their meaning. A black void opened
in my mind and I fell through. Around me, unknown by me, the battle
commenced.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">As the fog cleared, I was standing looking
along a dark road, my feet inches from entering onto it. A voice, a
kindly familiar voice spoke to me.</p>
<p class="western">"That my son is the road to your destiny, you
must walk it alone, be brave and all will be as it should be." I
turned, facing the midriff of a woman, looking up, I smiled into
the face of my beautiful mother, she has always been with me and
now she is sending me away, confusion exploded in my thoughts, what
have I done wrong? I screamed out mentally. Why must I leave, what
awaits me along this dark black road?</p>
<p class="western">"Child I am not sending you away, I am
sending you to complete the prophases; your time is fast
approaching."</p>
<p class="western">The lines scared into her face filled me with
tears, my mother looked at me, she with single tear forming in her
eye, on one level I knew that she was not my real mother! I knew
that she had found me or so her tale went, but she had acted as my
mother, and I thought of her kindness and care of me as being
motherly, but now she wanted something of me, something scary and
desperate. She needed me to leave her, to be brave and face my
future. I did not feel ready to face the future, but choice and
readiness' had no bearing on the here and now of her wishes.</p>
<p class="western">She shimmered infront of me, vanishing as I
had seen her do before. She has power in her old bones, a power
that I as a child do not understand, but I have witnessed used many
times. When asked by me about her life, she always answered that
she is a white witch, a good witch, provided by the fates to give
aid to me. Now as she vanishes, leaving me facing the long road, I
wonder.</p>
<p class="western">Slowly as I step out along the road, a cloud
confuses my thoughts, my memories of our time together fade until I
am a lone child, a little boy, standing now at the end of a long
walk, exhausted by my efforts, staring at a tree growing out of a
stone plinth. Her face is gone, all memory of her removed, and I am
alone, I am an enigma only to the soldier that would soon
discovered me.</p>
<p class="western">My life has travelled the route that she
expected of me, yet I had not known that, nor had I recognised her
delicate features or aged wisdom when she had tested me for the
council. Now I sat looking out at the battlefield watching as my
troops clashed with Nailstead's, listening to the air rent with the
screams of death, not knowing that my mother or the woman that had
acted as a mother to me, was also the witch in the mountains that
I, and all civilization were depending on for our ultimate
salvation.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Sire are you all right?"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch was tending to me; he had loosened
my tunic, removed my breast plate, and was trying to reach my mind
with his questions. I tried to nod, I tried to speak to him, to
reassure him that I was fine, but all I could do was cough. A
hacking, chest ripping cough, which finally cleared the fog from my
lungs, allowing me to breathe freely once more. The clean air
replaced the fog, which in turn cleared my head returning to me my
thoughts, but with the memory of my encounter with the witch
remaining. I knew her now, I still had no option but to trust her,
she would shine through just as she had said she would, it was not
the people or the coming battle that she was manipulating, it was
I, and it always had been I realised at long last.</p>
<p class="western">Far from where I sat realising how fate had
been usurped by the witch, the dwarf was looking out over the left
flank of my defences, thinking hard.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">His friend the King was over there waiting
for the battle to explode in violence; the first waves of
Nailstead's army had been contained after a fashion, out there on
the plain. What have we missed wondered the very puzzled dwarf
knowing that there was something, so little just a hint of some
concealed meaning to an event unseen or misunderstood, something
important perhaps even deadly to their cause. Desperately he sought
for anything that might clarify the threat he felt looming ever
closer to them all.</p>
<p class="western">He thought back to an interview with the King
held a few days after his safe return from his scouting mission. He
played that interview through his mind. He was in the King's
private office, sitting next to Iffilditch the Elf, talking about
the rock trolls. Iffilditch had described his encounter and the
amazing flight of such large creatures. Unfortunately, no sighting
or sign of the six formidable enemies had so far been reported.
They had just flown of into the night sky and vanished.</p>
<p class="western">The three of them had discussed the incident
but with no idea as to what they, the troll's, were about, or where
they had gone, there was little other than being watchful that they
could do. Still the dwarf puzzled over their disappearance, he came
to the conclusion that they were hidden somewhere just waiting to
break out and cause mayhem on an unprecedented scale in the only
way that rock trolls could.</p>
<p class="western">He also realised that six rock troll's would
be very difficult to halt. Now he was sitting feeling concerned
looking towards the battlefield, but as well as watching he was
also wondering how might they, the rock trolls be used by
Nailstead, and it was only when he asked himself, 'who they might
be targeted against,' that a mental picture of the creatures
rearing up from within the earth, and charging towards the King
filled his mind.</p>
<p class="western">Before he was even aware of it he had jumped
to his feet and charged towards a horse mounted lancer, reaching up
he grasping the horses bridle, he demanded that the rider dismount.
The Lancer just looked down at the frantic dwarf not recognizing
him, and remained sitting firm in his saddle. He was not going to
give up his horse so that a dwarf could run away from the coming
battle. With contempt in his voice he said.</p>
<p class="western">"Get back to your position you ..." That was
as far as he got! It is only a fool that calls a dwarf a coward,
and a fool does not deserve to be treated with respect. The dwarf
reached out, flipping the rider's foot out of his stirrup, and with
a sharp tug he unseated the lancer, who fell, tumbling in a
cacophony of metal armour entangling to the floor. The dwarf had
the rains in one hand and was pulling himself into the lancer
saddle with the other, whilst geeing the horse up and away. Dwarves
as a whole are not good riders, and he was no different to others,
but at least he could stay in the saddle reasonably well.</p>
<p class="western">All around him voices shouted for him to
halt, some lancers obviously friends of the unseated rider, turned,
clearly intending to give chase to the dwarf, but under bellowed
orders of their officer, they about faced once more.</p>
<p class="western">"Let the dwarf go" shouted a sergeant of the
guard who had recognised the horse stealer, and realised that
something important was happening.</p>
<p class="western">"Face the enemy, be ready," the sergeant
bellowed. "That is the King's Dwarf and he must be about something
special!" Having disentangled himself and reordered and replaced
his armour, the fallen lancer looked about him for another horse.
All about him his friends were now laughing, which did little for
the fallen's temper; he swore all manner of evil revenges that he
would extract on the dwarves body when next they next met. He found
a spare horse, not such a good one as his that had been stolen from
beneath him, but sound enough. He mounted, returning to his unit
with a last baleful glare after the fast departing dwarf.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf pushed the strange mount as fast as
the creature could run, soon it would have to be slowed to a trot
but the dwarf intended to cover as much ground as he could, as fast
as possible. He raced past the lines of defenders riding mostly out
of control, desperate to attend to the King's side. He knew where
or at least who, the rock trolls were going to target, and his
loyalty to his friend and King demanded that he attempt to carry
him a warning. He could only hope that he would arrive in time to
save the King from a certain death, even if doing so meant his own
demise. Only the King's safety held importance for the dwarf as he
swerved the horse around an arms wagon, spooking its team by the
closeness of his rounding. The wagon driver raised his whip but
only shook his fist at the fast diminishing dwarf before continuing
with his necessary journey.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Far behind the battle lines, at the base of a
rock cliff the ground began to shake, something moved the loose
earth, digging its way out of the ground. Soil clods flew threw the
air, scattering and shattering into dust, as powerful fingers
flexed upwards. The Rock trolls had arisen.</p>
<p class="western">They had flown across the nighttime skyline
unseen. Their landing had been far from subtle each had crashed
into the rock cliffs further below the entry point of the witches
cavern than was intended. There they had used their massive
strength to carve out first a hiding place in the rock. Then they
had begun in earnest to dig. For a hundred feet they dug straight
forwards into the cliff edge until they as one stopped, slowly they
turned their attention upwards.</p>
<p class="western">They dug and scraped out rock and soil
tunneling towards their goal. Near to the surface they felt the
heat of the day warming the ground which they dug through.
Break-out would occur soon if they continued, so they again stopped
their digging, instead sleeping away the next few days in
anticipation of the attack to come.</p>
<p class="western">They would know the time to launch themselves
out of the ground, to batter down the solid door and force entry
into the witches cave system. They were clear of intent, there was
only one thing that they had been charged to do, 'kill the witch!'
The chant repeated in each of the resting creatures brains, 'Kill
the Witch,' time after time, nothing else mattered, no one else
mattered to them, just the single desire, deeply imprinted into
their thoughts mattered to them, 'kill the witch, dead!' Crush her
out of existence and be sure that she is dead! Stomp her body into
the ground, be sure to kill the witch, dead!</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Nailstead stood on the high ground which
overlooked the distant spread out plain, his attention fixed on the
closed in weather beyond him, knowing the source of his troop's
misery he looked out across to the distant mountains. His
instructions had been given, his battle plan instigated, and his
most powerful allies were right now preparing their attack. Soon
the witch would be dead. The King would have lost his most powerful
of allies, and from that point on, his regaining the power that had
been usurped from him would be assured.</p>
<p class="western">The King, the usurper would soon be dead!
Beneath the dark cowl that always covered his head, the dark one
smiled an evil smile one of pure pleasure to come at the mayhem
about to be unleashed.</p>
<p class="western">His troops died before him frozen where they
fell; but he had plenty more of them behind him. Those out there
were the distraction, the link to him that served only one purpose,
to occupy the King by dieing. Witch created snows billowed as he
raised his arms, time for him to distract the witch, time to fight
back. He sent a wind billowing out from his fingertips, a wind that
would swirl around the falling snows, gathering them together
before finally blowing her storm away. His troops would be revealed
to the King's archers, they were already gathering together, as
more poured along the black road then spread out seemingly as the
front spur of his attack. Below him thousands would die but by the
end of this day, Nailstead was certain that he will have won his
victory, and the open unresisting lands beyond the King's army
would be ripe for his picking.</p>
<p class="western">"Those that have betrayed me will suffer my
wrath, their families will suffer, and their friends will suffer,
everyone must suffer for my pain." Nalistead could feel his
mounting excitement, he screamed out to the billowing winds, gusts
born of his own creation.</p>
<p class="western">'They must all suffer! I will rule this land
as I should have, and any that oppose me will be crushed into dust
his thought raged.' "No," he screamed! "Not dust, less than dust,
into nothing, nothing, do you hear me, nothing!" his words were
born away from him on the wind.</p>
