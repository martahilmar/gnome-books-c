<p class="western">The King astride a pure white mount passed
for the last time beneath the last gate, which guarded the entrance
to his Elvin castle. The King looked out at the sea of faces turned
as one to mark his progress. High on the walls, behind and above
him, mostly hidden by the ramparts, trumpeters heralded the King's
last march. Spread before him the path cleared of his people as he
rode towards a half-moon of men, all knights of his choosing, all
honored by being selected, all dedicated to him and their home
world.</p>
<p class="western">The choosing had been done not as the King
had expected on the thirtieth day, but through-out the preceding
month; a knight would put himself forward and Vindec would look at
him and then nod or shake his head, that was it simple and final,
chosen or rejected. Now they all waited for him to lead them out to
the place of waiting.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec stood before the half-moon watching
his King and friend approach. The crowds fell silent as the regal
procession closed on the half-circle, all their knew that they were
witnessing their King's final march, that soon he will be gone from
them, and they would be the poorer for his having departed. All
also knew of the times to come, when he, and they, would rally to
the call and with honour fall upon the enemies of his people. They
were proud of their King, though immensely saddened at his
departure.</p>
<p class="western">The crowd parted to allow a portly dwarf to
push his way forward; he desired to see both his King and his work
for the last time. The sword he had created for the King hung as it
should, perfectly balanced at the Kings side, ruby eyes glittering
in the sunlight. The fat dwarf thought of the hours of work he had
expended into the process of the creating of the weapon, of the
folding of glowing hot metals. Of the bonding into those metals the
shard of stone, which much to his surprise had melded
perfectly.</p>
<p class="western">He repeated every hammer blow in his mind,
every plunge into icy water of the witheringly hot metal. Then the
reheating, one thousand folds all within a single month! The
casting of the fighting guard had been completed in a single
pouring! He remembered his fear of failure as the moulds had
parted, his joy as their parting revealed for the first time the
fine detail he had cast within.</p>
<p class="western">The joining of grip to blade had passed with
ease; the insertion of the eyes had taken place overnight and
without his assistance. The stones had not been out of their cloth
bag, when weary after the long day he had retired for the night.
The next morning the bag had been empty when he unsealed it in
preparation to inserting the gems. To his horror he believed then
that he had been robbed! He ran to the guards, who insisted that
none had entered his place. He ran back to his workroom convincing
himself that he had indeed removed the stones.</p>
<p class="western">He looked at the table with its clamps. His
eyes drawn to the pommel of the weapon and then to the twin cast
heads of the snakes. That was when he really understood the power
residing in the weapon he was creating. The stones he had lost were
all present, fitted perfectly into their eye sockets, gleaming as
though alive. Perhaps they are he thought, as once more and for the
last time he looked up from his position in the crowd, one watcher,
one citizen, one with a powerful secret!</p>
<p class="western">To his left farmers and commoners, to his
right more of the same, in the middle, him; a craftsman, respected
for his work, but bearing a secret and a pride that none but his
closes relatives might ever be told. Would they, he wondered, would
they believe him if he told them that he made the one true sword,
the King's weapon. That he, a humble worker of metals named the
might symbol of power, and that he had decided to call the sword he
had fashioned, Excalibur.</p>
<p class="western">The King glanced down from his mount at just
the right point to bequeath a knowing secret smile onto the dwarf.
His hand moved to rest easily on the rounded pommel, his face
grinned with pride. The simple nod that followed became the talking
point of all that were lucky enough to be honored by the dwarf
craftsman's tale. When his time finally arrived and he passed over,
the dwarf died a happy fulfilled weapon smith. A dwarf with a
secret history known only to his family. A history that would
reside forever alongside of the King's of Kings tale, and the
legend of his sword Excalibur, the weapon which he had made and so
named.</p>
<p class="western">The King halted his steed before the
magician, he that had by his efforts had led or manipulated the
King to this point. Before them his knights waited, eager but
contained, ready to follow their King into the unknown and to, at
his bidding, lay down their lives to protect the truth and goodness
they all believed in.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec turned away from the King, stepping
towards a twin wheeled narrow, lightweight wagon; pulled not by a
sturdy horse, or a might beast of burden, but pulled by a donkey, a
creature usually held for the carrying of light burdens, or for
children to master the art of riding on. He picked up the reins,
talking quietly to the beast and set of on the long walk. The King
followed, passing the council on its Dias, walking past his friends
the dwarf and Iffilditch, his last thought being about the elf
Fedic; he wondered at the trouble that this one would cause, but
accepted that there was little that he could do.</p>
<p class="western">Fedic had been selected as second to
Iffilditch, not by him, but by the council, and the decision stood,
no matter what concerns the King might have over the choice and
appointment.</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch tried to smile but failed, he had
repeatedly requested to be one of the King's chosen knights, and
repeatedly he had been turned down, rejected by Vindec. The King
wanted him, he would he knew miss his wise guidance, but the King
listened to Vindec and accepted that Iffilditch had a role to play
in the times to come. His family would become the first dynasty,
they would guide the Elvin people and the community through many
troubles, and one day in the future, he the King would dance at an
Iffilditch wedding which would unify the world.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf saluted, next to him and between
him and Iffilditch stood the wolf. It shook its head only once
before making a decision, then it leapt from the raised dais and
raced across the dusty ground, taking up position next to the King.
Riding into a future and establishing a dynasty of its own. Vindec
knew of the wolf's presence and accepted it, the King looked down
and accepted the wolf, and all accepted the wolf including the
Lifestone that awaited their arrival. The future was set, the wolf
named Monster had decided, his place was set and assured through
out time.</p>
