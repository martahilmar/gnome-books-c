<p class="western">Three days passed from the dwarf's arrival
before the elf named Iffilditch, son of Iffilditch, great grandson
of Iffilditch the Elder, returned. He entered my bed chamber in the
twilight of late evening, unbidden, but confident that I would wish
to see him. He was right, my relief that he had returned from the
mountainous territory that was Nailstead's fortress, and in one
piece, filled me with both pride and a feeling of glory in waiting.
He sat unbidden on my bed, bowed his head and then with a smile
that could light the world said.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire, I am back and with news."</p>
<p class="western">"I can see that you are back, so tell me,
what did you find? I didn't mention that the dwarf had returned
first, or what he had told me. I wanted Iffilditch to regale me
with his own impressions, to fill in any misunderstandings or
subtle developments. Dwarves I know are straightforward people,
true, honest and reliable. They call a stone a stone, because it is
a stone, yet they would describe the finest jewel in the land as a
glittering stone, because in essence, they believe, that is what it
is, just a stone.</p>
<p class="western">Elves on the other hand are an ephemeral
people, with a deep respect and understanding of the world in which
they live. As a simple comparison of the two cultures, the stone is
a good choice. Dwarves have but one word for stone in their
language, where as the elves have over a thousand ways of
describing every facet that creates that same stone. The difference
is only in semantics, but hidden within a flowing description, is a
variety of extra layers of thought and observation.</p>
<p class="western">Hence I had sent an elf out into the wilds. I
sat upright in my bed, ready to listen and learn of the discoveries
made by Iffilditch. He, I knew, would be accurate of texture to the
truth, creating a description which would defy argument. As such,
it was the elves report that I would listen to most, but not to say
that the words of the dwarf would not be treated with an equal
level of acceptance. The combination of both of their information
would form two thirds, I hoped, of the whole picture; thus setting
me on the right track to protecting my world and its people.</p>
<p class="western">"Thank you for the escort."</p>
<p class="western">He sounded slightly peeved, which with the
benefit of hindsight I could understand. It had been a mistake, not
of my direct doing, but one instigated by the actions of my guards,
who had thought that they were fulfilling my wishes. I would love
to have seen their faces when this elf infront of me had simply
vanished from their midst.</p>
<p class="western">"My pleasure." I too could be sarcastic, the
elf smiled back.</p>
<p class="western">"It is as I thought it to be, I can see that
now."</p>
<p class="western">Anyway let's forget the rather unexpected or
wanted beginning of your mission, and cut to the more important
points of your discovery.</p>
<p class="western">"No Sire, lets not forget the beginning,
because through the beginning I detected a creature watching our
outposts, needless to say the creature no longer watches, and its
brethren will mourn it passing, but not I, or I think you will. I
shook my head slightly disturbed that a dark creature could conceal
itself close enough to our borders, to be able to watch our post
guards unwittingly performing their respective duties.</p>
<p class="western">"How come my guards didn't locate the
creature?" The thought burst from my lips instead of remaining in
my head.</p>
<p class="western">"They are not so good at their jobs, as I am
at mine, thinks I Sire."</p>
<p class="western">He could be bloody cocky, but the truth
behind his words was apparent, which is also why I chose him to
venture into the lands of instant death for the unwary
traveler.</p>
<p class="western">I reached out to my bedside table picking up
a flute of water, and downing it in one; my mouth remained dry even
after the water had swished away.</p>
<p class="western">"So you departed from them, did you know that
there was some debate as to whether to follow you or not? Luckily
they decided against such, but I gather it was a near thing."</p>
<p class="western">"I know Sire; I was less than four feet from
the Captain whilst he discussed what they should do, had he decided
that entering further was within his remit I would have dissuaded
him."</p>
<p class="western">"How?"</p>
<p class="western">"That does not really matter Sire as such
actions proved unnecessary; I believe that there are other things
that happened of far greater importance to you now!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Being a King is an awesome responsibility,
being a King faced with an upcoming war, a battle for survival, is
more than merely awesome in scope, it is terrifying. There are
though some advantages to being a King, and normally, one of them
is the deference to my wishes that those around me show! Those
around me obviously did not include this Iffilditch!</p>
<p class="western">I have known him nearly since my first days
in this castle; he was assigned by the Council to educate me, not
in book learning, but in the noble art of protecting oneself. He
had taught me to hunt, to fish, to catch food of all varieties. He
had instructed me in the best and most delicious ways to prepare
game, which had been caught an hour earlier, and was to be eaten an
hour later. He had become both a trusted friend and mentor to me
throughout my growing years.</p>
<p class="western">Still I had viewed him as an equal, he being
only slightly older than me or so I had surmised, judging him by
the standards of age that exist around me, and are familiar to me.
I often found myself wondering how he had packed in so much
practical experience, learnt so much more than I knew, and had
risen to a position from which he was placed by the witch no less,
next to me. It was some years later that I found that my companion
and by then trusted friend was not as I had decided, a year or two
older than me.</p>
<p class="western">Over time I learnt that his family was one of
the oldest residing in this world. That his name had been chosen
centuries earlier, and the tradition of naming the first son by
such choosing had been passed down through the generations to now.
Still I wondered; so one day whilst we sat silently on an old log
made bench, listening to the sounds of the woods, I braved enough
courage to as him. It seemed a simple question to ask, but it was a
bit of a surprise when he turned to me with an answer. My question
I remember was. "Friend, tell me how old are you now?"</p>
<p class="western">For reasons that I then did not understand,
he looked startled at my question. He frowned slightly, I thought
that I had been impertinent, but no, it was more than that, much
more. He looked away, studying a distant grove of trees, ignoring
my question, but obviously trying to decide whether to answer me. I
was just about to let my interest have full rein, when he turned
back to face me. He looked me in the eyes, he was probably the only
person that ever did that, and sometimes it could be quite
unnerving, the way he studied me. Much like the old men who teach,
study the students in their classes.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I Sire am your friend, I will always be your
friend, trust me when I tell you that my bow, my mind and my heart
belong to you. Your question will open up many doors for you if I
am to answer it. You will be both surprised and shocked. Your
reaction will be strange and may change our friendship, but I hope
not."</p>
<p class="western">"Nothing can change our friendship
Iffilditch, nothing in this world; you are forever my companion, my
equal, my friend! I know I am a King, but you come from a noble
lineage and I accept that makes us equals. We have known each other
for four long years, been closer than brothers, yet in some ways I
know little about you, and as your friend I wish to know more, so
please tell me."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">He had been right and I had been wrong, what
he told me that day did change my thoughts about him, not in a
derogatory way, but change they did. My perception of him was way
off beam; he looked me in the face asking me a question of his
own.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"How old are you now?"</p>
<p class="western">I was a little surprised by the question, he
knew how old I was, he was at my twelfth year birthday, I said
twelve.</p>
<p class="western">"How old am I Sire?"</p>
<p class="western">I stopped, hesitating slightly thinking that
he was a little older than me, but not that much, he just knew so
much more. He had mastered so many skills more than I, but that was
because elves are quick learners, or so I believed then.</p>
<p class="western">"Fifteen or so." I guessed, hoping I wouldn't
offend him.</p>
<p class="western">He did me the courtesy of not laughing at me,
but he couldn't resist a wry smile.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire, my friend, my King to be." He bowed
before me. "I am not fifteen nor twenty, not even thirty years old.
Sire I am two hundred and sixteen years old this coming fall!" I
remember the shock I felt at his words, the disbelief that swamped
my mind, two hundred and sixteen years old to my twelve, no wonder
he understood so much more than I.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">He coughed drawing me from my reminiscences
back to the present time and place. He was watching my face
intently, waiting I realised, eager to continue his report.</p>
<p class="western">"Sorry old friend, just thinking back." I
looked at him feeling slightly stupid, but now my mind was again
focused, I waved him to continue.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Sire, I departed the area near to the first
deep valley, once of course the troop of escorts had about turned,
and ridden away. I watched them go as I knew the creature would be
watching. Satisfied that I had left long enough for it to decide
that a report of what it had witnessed, was more important than
remaining on watch. I slipped from behind the low gorse bush that
concealed me. Pulling together my pack and standing up for the
first time since dismounting."</p>
<p class="western">"But!" I started to interrupt him, then at
his glance stopped. Now perhaps was not the most opportune time to
question him about his disappearing act. Besides, I had seen him
vanish before my own eyes, when I was still a child and had thought
that he was also.</p>
<p class="western">"Knowing that the pathway leading into the
mountains was now clear of its presence, I strode out, heading deep
into enemy territory, flitting ghost like along the valley edges,
always looking for signs of the watchers having passed this way. I
decided that it would benefit us if the creature failed to make a
report. As some smarter enemy might consider and start to wonder,
why had a mounted guard ridden close, then halted, then departed,
without seemingly having a sensible purpose. That was a line of
thought which I did not want to occur in our enemies. It would be
better if no report was made, and the lone watcher was thought to
have had a mishap, rather than for it to arrive into some
encampment, babbling of strange occurrences."</p>
<p class="western">"Half a day later I located the first sign of
a passing, it wasn't much, and it was in the very center of the
narrowing valley. Clearly the creature unlike me, had traveled in
plain view, unafraid of its presence being detected, where as I had
been forced to conceal my movements, thus slowing me down. Despite
the need for secrecy in my travel, the creature had only gained a
half day on me, and now I was picking up speed. The ground below my
feet was hard and rocky and would carry little trace of my passing.
Whereas the creature left tiny indications in the central wind born
dust of the narrowing valley, sign that any blind tracker, one of
no skill, could easily follow. I tracked from a safe distance,
always closing but with caution, hoping that there would be time
enough to intercept the creature before it contacted its
allies."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch looked slightly concerned to me at
something that had popped into his mind, or perhaps something that
had happened whilst he was out there. Taking the lead, I asked if
he caught the creature and what it was?</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Yes I caught the creature, what it was, is a
hard one to define Sire! It looked human for the most parts of its
body, but by the time you reached where its arms should be, you
began to realise that it is not of mine or any other human kind.
Its arms protrude out of the trunk of its body; they have three
joints, unlike our two. Ending in blunt flat fingers which are
joined by loose flaps of skin. The head is probably the ugliest
mono eyed of faces, something that only its mother could love is
the best way that I can describe it to you Sire."</p>
<p class="western">"Sounds pleasant, I suppose you killed
it?"</p>
<p class="western">"Yes, deader than yesterday."</p>
<p class="western">"Good, I thought you might have." I looked at
him; still there was the air about him, an air that only someone
that has known him as long as I had might detect. "So what went
wrong then?"</p>
<p class="western">"How the?"</p>
<p class="western">I laughed, it seemed the right thing to do;
besides the confusion on his face was funny, and it made a great
change for me to catch him on the hop, rather than the other way
about.</p>
<p class="western">"Come on old friend, out with it, spill the
beans, bloody hell Iffilditch tell me, what went wrong?"</p>
<p class="western">"Sire, I had closed on the creature, it
seemed unaware of my presence so I decided that a death without
warning would befit such a creature. I removed my bow, this
one."</p>
<p class="western">He held out his bow, it was short with
tightly stretched gut string which joined each distinctive curve at
each end. I had seen it many times and knew his prowess with the
weapon of Elvin choice. He could shoot one of his thin, light,
neatly feathered arrows through the eye of a needle if he so
decided. The creature he described would be dead before it knew it
had been fired upon, of that fact I was sure.</p>
<p class="western">"As I drew a bead on the thing it turned
slightly allowing for the perfect killing shot, my shaft penetrated
its side, piercing upwards to where I presume it had a beating
heart. It straightened up in shock as the fletch vibrated against
its side, then it fell backwards, dead."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">I was right, always put your faith in an
Elvin arrow. The elves are master bar none with the traditional
weapon of their people. That isn't to say that they are not good
with other weapons, but they are definately better with the bow. A
good elf can fire thrice as fast as the best human archer and with
half the missed shots that such speed unusually entails. Iffilditch
I knew was one of the very best archers the Elvin people had to
offer, and his shot, from distance confirmed my belief.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I stepped out into the dell that it had
chosen for a camp, the fire it had laid was just beginning to burn
nicely, and I, like it, decided that its use could be of benefit.
It was as I approached the dead creature that things turned bad. It
was not alone, it should have been, as I had been tracking only a
single set of spore and prints, but it wasn't! The other creature
was the double of the dead first one, it came out from the
undergrowth seeing first its companion and the arrow sticking out
of its side, then me crossing the dell towards it, bow held
uselessly unloaded at my side!"</p>
<p class="western">I cannot remember the last time I had caught
Iffilditch out in a hunter's match, if I ever had!</p>
<p class="western">"It surprised you?"</p>
<p class="western">"Probably not as much as I surprised it,
Sire, but yes, it surprised me! We both reached for weapons at the
sametime, it picking up a long pike with a wicked looking jagged
blade topping the shaft, I went for an arrow, intending to shoot
this creature like I had its companion. It was faster, instead of
charging forwards with its weapon, it thrust it at me, then letting
go it allowed the weapon to fly."</p>
<p class="western">"I felt the blade skim across my spine as I
dived away from the flying point. The haft dropped slightly in
flight catching me a blow to the head, slightly stunning me. I
tumbled into the dusty floor, disorientated slightly. Pushing my
arms out I attempted to rise. The creature was already lunging
across the fire, jumping through the burning flames to get at me.
In mid-air, with no way to change its direction, something large
and grey collided with it casting it aside the interloper sailed on
past landing and turning ready to fight on.</p>
<p class="western">"I spun around using one arm, whilst the
other reached for my dagger. The newcomer had landed on confident
feet; I whipped around tensing, as my enemy started to rise from
where it had fallen. Tough creature my enemy, I remembered
thinking, a blow like that would have put me down for a while, it
though pushed up, gathered itself then stood, dropping into a
crouch ready to defend itself. My savoir was equally ready for the
fight; it snarled loudly, gaping mouth opening to reveal sharp
pointed teeth, the teeth of a natural hunter. The legs propelled it
forwards, directly through the fire which surprised me, as wild
animals usually avoid fire! This one didn't, it used the leaping
flames to mask its attack."</p>
<p class="western">"The creature without its pike reached down
trying to retrieve something from a heavy leather boot, it failed.
The wolf, for that was what the creature that defended me was, bit
deep into the arm, twisting its head, pulling back with all four
legs scrabbling at the dust floor. The sound Sire, I have never
heard such a growl. I was only glad that this wolf had decided that
the creature made a better target, than I. The fight went on,
neither could inflict a fatal blow to the other, but then I
realised that I could, so I picked up my bow, gathered an arrow
from the dust where they had fallen, shaking it once to clear the
flights, then as fast as I could I let it loose."</p>
<p class="western">"The fletch pierced the creature beneath the
breast bone, penetrating deeply, but not deeply enough. The wolf
dragged back sensing its prey's distraction, it let go of the arm
it held, lunging towards a leg instead, gripping it below the knee
joint and biting down hard. The creature screamed in agony as the
wolf's teeth shattered its leg bone. My second arrow flew straight
and true, piercing the creature's neck and passing right through
it. Death was not instant for the creature, but it was sure."</p>
<p class="western">"The weakening of its prey allowed the
snarling wolf to bite again, deep blood welled out of the wound in
the creature's leg then the wolf released and clamped down again,
chattering its teeth upwards to the thigh before it released again.
I expected the wolf to attack repeatedly, instead Sire, it backed
away from the fast dying creature, it shook it head once, then
stood watching. Slowly it turned it shaggy head towards me, I was
reaching out for another arrow, thinking that it intended to attack
me, the wolf sat down on its haunches, the most threatening thing
it did in response to my movement was to emit a single penetrating
growl. I slowly released the arrow, letting it fall back into the
dust, then as a matter of trust I placed the bow on the ground as
well."</p>
<p class="western">"The wolf watched my every movement,
interested, but not really it would seem that interested in me. I
began to wonder if the creature had been injured but a minute later
when it stood up and approached the now dead creature, we had
killed; I knew that no such injury had been incurred. I thought for
a second; knowing that it was a powerful beast and if it attacked
me, I would be very unlikely to win the confrontation so I decided
that I would not antagonize it. The wolf for its part seemed more
interested in the dead, than in me the living, so slowly I sat
upright and made myself comfortable."</p>
<p class="western">"I pulled my back pack towards me, I reached
into the accompaniment of a low growl and removed a pack of jerked
traveling meat. I took one piece for myself and threw the rest of
the pack near to, but not at the wolf. Hoping that it would prefer
to eat my offering, rather than me? It sniffed at the package,
placed a single huge paw onto the paper and with a flick of its
nose, opened the packet. The meat lasted slightly longer than it
had taken the wolf to open that packet, but I felt that there was a
strange kind of bond which had developed between me and that wild
animal."</p>
<p class="western">"Having eaten, the wolf approached the fire,
it sniffed at the air once or twice before laying down, obviously
enjoying the heat. As for me Sire, I breathed out, I think that I
had forgotten to breathe altogether and now I breathed in and out
again, slowly getting back my breath and nerve. The wolf had its
head resting on its paws and seemed to be sound asleep. It had
decided to trust me, so therefore I would trust it."</p>
<p class="western">"Sire I sat by that fire across from the
sleeping wolf studying the creature that had inadvertently saved my
life, and had apparently accepted my presence. The first thing I
had noticed as it fought against the creature was how large and
well muscled this wolf was. I have encountered many relatives to
this animal, but I have never seen a creature of this size! Many a
hunter would be interested in its hide as a wall trophy, but I
think, after looking at it, as I had, that perhaps it would be the
creature's hunters that would become the trophy, not this wolf. Its
paws, Sire, its paws were larger than you hands, each one!"</p>
<p class="western">I looked at my hands they were big that was
for sure, but a wolf having pads larger was a bit hard to believe,
had I received the description form any but Iffilditch I would have
treated it with deep suspicion.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"The wolf twitched a couple of time as I
watched it resting, dreaming perhaps, though what a monster wolf
like this would dream about, is beyond my understanding, but the
night passed silently and undisturbed."</p>
<p class="western">'Silently.' I looked up at my elf, repeating
his word mentally first, adding a question of my own. "Why
silently?"</p>
<p class="western">"The night Sire fell silent the moment that
the wolf had appeared, all of the night creatures seemed to know of
his presence and fell silent as one, whether out of fear of the
powerful wolf, or respect for it I don't know, but either way Sire,
the night passed in an unnatural silence. Though Sire,
occasionally, I will admit that the peace was shattered by a deep
rumbling snore. Coupled with a deep growl, from the sleeping wolf,
but other than that Sire, 'silently' as I have stated."</p>
<p class="western">"The next morning I awoke to find myself on
my side, facing towards the embers of our dying fire, looking
directly into the open mouth of the wolf. It startled me, but
somehow I remained still. The creature was laying down, it's
powerful hairy paws extended towards me, it's head held high and as
I have stated, it's mouth open. The tongue I could see inside of
the teeth lined jaws was a deep red in colour and coated with
saliva, though not excessively."</p>
<p class="western">"I slowly sat up, automatically checking the
dell in which we had camped, it was both a pointless and fruitless
search, primarily I recognised because of the wolf's presence. It
would have reacted were there any creature around for a mile or
more, let alone in or around our encampment. The wolf tracked my
movements as I sat up, I don't know why, but I smiled at the
creature. It in turn opened its mouth further, tilting back its
huge shaggy head and stretched the powerful muscles of its neck,
before relaxing again."</p>
<p class="western">"The day was well under way, so I decided
that I was going to have to move, despite what the wolf might
think. I slowly stood, keeping my eyes on the creature. It twitched
its head, raised a single powerfully clawed paw and rolled
unconcernedly onto its side. I almost had to laugh, it seemed as
though the wolf was teasing me! There was something about this
animal, something very different, almost as though it had at
sometime been domesticated! No, that's not right, not domesticated,
more friends with a human and some how it liked their, our company,
and that included me."</p>
<p class="western">"Clearly the wolf didn't like the creatures,
as it had shown with a devastating display of agility and power the
previous night. Standing, I lent towards my pack, my bow was
resting against it. The wolf twitched, one eye fixed on my hand, I
hesitated. Something about the eye watching me warned me that
despite being apparently relaxed, the wolf was still ready to
defend itself, if necessary? I began to wonder if I really needed
breakfast right then, but then again the wolf had saved me
yesterday, all I had to do was show it that I meant it no
harm."</p>
<p class="western">"Simple a thing to think but it is hard to
envisage how to do it Sire, still the question in my mind right
then was. 'How do I show a wild animal that I mean it no harm?' The
answer, when it came to me, was quite simple, but at the same time
extraordinary. I glanced at the wolf, took a deep breath and
smiling I said. "Morning mate, breakfast for two in five minutes!"
Then without hesitation I reached down, grasped a single strap of
my bag and totally ignoring the bow resting across the bag, I
lifted it up, standing straight."</p>
<p class="western">"I deliberately turned towards the dying
embers of the fire, totally ignoring the flat out wolf, placing my
trust in it. Thus I convinced the creature that I meant it no harm.
Though in the dark recesses of my mind, I was not sure whether the
creature already knew that, and was just teasing me again. Before
retiring I had placed a large flat stone into the heart of the
fire, ready for this morning. It lay there still, now covered in
wood ash, but beneath that ready all the same for cooking on.
Taking a cloth from my bag I wiped the stone, being careful not to
burn my hand, and then I set to with the cooking."</p>
<p class="western">"I had eggs and sliced meat, with potato
bread to finish, which would all cook easily on the retained heat
in the rock. Placing them carefully I crouched down. Adding a small
can to the fire embers and surrounding it with kindling wood,
encouraging the fire to reignite and burn hot. Inside of the can
were granules and water, it would make for a fine hot drink and
coupled with the fast cooking food, would set me up for the day
ahead's traveling. As the meat cooked, the wolf showed signs of
interest. It had rolled off its side and was now watching
everything that I did."</p>
<p class="western">"I had only one plate off of which to eat,
but that didn't seem to bother the wolf. I found a flat stone and
putting it next to the fire (not to close) I served out, equally
sharing my meal with my furred guest. The wolf sniffed at the
offered food, looked up at me, watching as I eat, then it tucked in
with the gusto that only a wild animal that does not know where its
next meal is coming from, let alone when it will arrive, can."</p>
<p class="western">"I chewed, enjoying the flavors, the meat was
perfect, just past tender, the bread soaked with meat juices filled
me up, and the hot drink warmed my bones. The wolf did nothing in
the way of savoring its food, but it did eat every last scrap and
seemed content. I scraped my plate into the fire and sat down to
plan my next steps into the unknown. The wolf managed to surprise,
and I admit, Sire, startle me slightly, by plodding over and
flopping down next to me. At one point it lifted its shaggy head
and placed it heavily on my lap. Demanding my attention! I have
hunted most of my life and never have I been so in touch with a
wild animal or it with me, but the growing bond between me and that
wolf just kept getting stronger."</p>
<p class="western">"Fed, I leant forwards not even considering
the effect such an action might have on the wolf. I picked the can
of brew out of the embers using a stick; I tilted it so that it
poured into my mug and sitting back again, drink in hand I set to
thinking. The Wolf having eaten his share lay still, looking at me,
as though asking what next. That was the something that I had sat
back to considering, what next?"</p>
<p class="western">"I had penetrated my enemies lair and was now
eager to delve deeper before returning home. The creature I had
tracked had led me in a slight curve to my point of entry and I
