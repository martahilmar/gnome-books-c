<p class="western">During the hour that followed many questions
were asked and some were even answered, though not necessarily
fully. Vindec addressed the reduced council, explaining to them
about the events that had led up to this point. He told of the
Lifestone, of his selection, of the defeat of the dark one, of the
opening of the portal that leads into the abyss. He described in
detail each step forward, but he held back on the details for the
further steps, and one piece of knowledge he locked away from the
conversations completely.</p>
<p class="western">The atmosphere became one of conspirators
gathered, as the discussions turned to the future. Vindec broached
the security of the abyss, knowing that he alone understood the
true nature and weaknesses of the prison. He began to outline the
problems' as all sat around an oak table brought in by the King's
guards to facilitate their comfort. The King looked to be in the
best of health but Vindec understood the illusion, when the time
came to explain the last detail he would have no choice but shatter
the illusion he had created, but for now, things must move on.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"The Abyss is holding, it will hold for many
years to come without assistance, but as time passes the strength
of its walls will suffer under the repeated attacks of those
contained within. The magic used to open the abyss is ancient, but
it is also not the strongest available!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Both the King and Iffilditch sat up further
and leant forward slightly as he said that, both held their
respective tongues, though the questions they wanted to ask were
clearly evident to Vindec when read from their faces and reactions.
He lifted a hand and silenced these most powerful leaders; much, he
thought, like a teacher he had once known who could command silence
in the class by the simplest of gestures.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec was puzzled by the ease of his
acceptance, admittedly the King had spoken up for him and demanded
of all that he be treated as his right hand man, but these two,
Iffilditch and Fedic seemed to be cooperating and accepting in a
way that surprised him. He would have to watch them, after all he
cautioned, they are both professional politicians and wise men in
their own right, so they know how to put on a show, and bend with
the wind in a storm. Then of course there is the King's unreserved
acceptance of his presence to consider, that to was strange, he
made a mental note to talk to the King at a more convenient and
private time, but for now he had a duty to continue with, if he was
going to ensure that all occurred as the legends demanded of
him.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec stood, turning away from the table
drawing an imaginary box in the air where all could clearly see it,
then he stepped back, muttering. Dense grey fog materialized, its
tendrils perfectly contained within the borders of his finger drawn
box. The clouds swirled before them, electric fire flashed, it was
as if they were watching a storm, the like of which they had never
before witnessed. Slowly, as Vindec continued his muttering the
clouds parted, forced aside by the power of his words. His mind
increased the metal thrust he was applying, the strain was immense
but the benefit of obtaining what he sought would be equal to the
strain expended.</p>
<p class="western">Lightening flared its resistance, fighting
back against the magic being asserted, then failing it passed from
view. The cloud faded, replaced by bright light which slowly began
to swim into the picture, now familiar images began to form with
definition. Rocks solidified, a green valley churned by thousands
of creatures having passed through it became evident. Then a black
hole appeared a dark uninviting cavern. The entrance to the abyss
formed for all to see, created by the mind of Vindec to emphasize
his coming point.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"That Sire, my Lord's is the doorway to
nowhere; that gentlemen is the great abyss in which resides
Nailstead! It is closed, sealed shut by magic, a container vast in
size, equal to the dimensions of this world. Lit by dark light, the
exact opposite of this fine world in which we all live. Every force
that should not exist on this world can be found within that
abyss!"</p>
<p class="western">"You mean...!" Said Iffilditch, having
grasped the significance of Vindec's words. "Everything is in equal
balance?"</p>
<p class="western">"Everything my Lord Elf, every little detail
of everything that does exist and some things that do not,
everything!" Vindec stressed, driving home his point.</p>
<p class="western">"All contained within by a magic, a magic
pushed to the limit of its capability, one that will eventually
fail, not necessarily in one big bang but more likely in the
parting of exits, the weakening of walls, the opening of portals.
Though not enough at any one time to release all that is contained,
it only requires the one prime occupant to find an exit and the
world will be back under threat!"</p>
<p class="western">"He will of course be constantly seeking out
such weaknesses; and I say to you all that he will find them
easily! Perhaps some already exist, perhaps the abyss is so
stretched that shallow magic points have already formed, then all
that is needed for Nailstead to escape once more is a gently push
with his arts, and every gain will become lost in that moment.</p>
<p class="western">The King grasped the situation and asked the
key question before his companions could give voice.</p>
<p class="western">"What then, if it is as you insist, that it
is hopeless do you expect us to do? How can we reinforce the abyss
and protect the peoples from this evil? Place troops around the
entry perhaps he suggested, with little confidence in the idea, he
was beginning to understand the size of the problem.</p>
<p class="western">"You know something don't you magician?"
Stated Iffilditch.</p>
<p class="western">"There is a way that the abyss might be
strengthened!"</p>
<p class="western">"Tell us!" King Arthur looked on, waiting for
the revelation he expected, dreading its arrival, but not knowing
why?</p>
<p class="western">"The legends tell of a time in the distant
future when the land and people will have changed, where the world
will have become the property of the humans, where we the elves and
the dwarfs will no longer live as one people".</p>
<p class="western">"A child's story not something for educated
men to consider!" Fedic sounded certain, though Vindec detected the
fear behind his bluster.</p>
<p class="western">"There is no Childs prophesy, that time will
come, though not in your life time, but be certain, it will come!
If the dark lord makes his escape during the time of mankind then
who will stand against him, and how; with no magic available to the
world of men there can be no hope of defeating him! Clearly there
can't, so it falls to us to ensure that he either can not escape,
or..." Vindec hesitated, now was the key moment; pass this hurdle
and the others as large as they seem will be easier to control.</p>
<p class="western">"Continue magician; tell us what you propose
to do to ensure the future safety of this world?" The King looked
across at Iffilditch, as usual the Elf had cut through the mists
directly to the heart of the problem.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec lowered his head, gathering together
his thoughts, preparing for the battle to come, then he
continued.</p>
<p class="western">"We must ensure that the binding force that
locks the abyss is securely protected; we must also ensure that
throughout the span of mankind the magic necessary to defeat an
outbreak from the abyss is available. There can be no simple
answer, no easy way, we are dealing with time on an immense scale,
but there is a way, only one, but it offers us hope!"</p>
<p class="western">"Explain?" One simple word fell from between
the pursed lips of the King.</p>
<p class="western">"The answer to it is complex, dangerous and
might fail, but there is no choice if there is to be any hope for
the future." Vindec looked directly into the Kings eyes, his
thoughts racing, his mind made up.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire in your pocket is a glowing stone, it
is not the whole of the stone only a sliver of it, cast free to
offer some hope to all. The rest of the stone is ancient and it is
that which opened the abyss, and that which will continue to keep
it closed. As the centuries pass the Lifestone as it is called in
legend will defend the peoples, but even the Lifestone can grow
weaker if place under enough stress, and the dark one will create
as much pressure against the bindings that the Lifestone creates
and maintains as he can."</p>
<p class="western">"Sometime in the distant future at least one
doorway will open and the Lifestone alone will be unable to contain
the forces seeking to exit through it. That is the time when the
stone needs the assistance of us all. That is the time that magic
capable and able to resist the incursions of the dark one must be
called forward to defend the worlds of fairy and man, to oppose and
if possible defeat the escapees and to contain the world from the
spread of their evil.</p>
<p class="western">First the Lifestone must be protected at all
costs. A home needs to be constructed for it to reside in, a place
safe from the passing of time. Once created the Lifestone needs to
be removed from where it currently resides and be taken to its new
home, and there be sealed in with strong binding magic. Protections
need to be formed and placed securely around it and links forever
ensured. That will guarantee the dark one remains secured for
century after centaury, long into the time of man."</p>
<p class="western">Vindec looked around the room, at his glance
the windows vanished covered by black light, the door vanished,
sealing them inside of the room and putting any potential listeners
on the far side of his concealing black light. The room gained a
feeling of enclosure, the air became heavy all around the watching,
selected few. Silence filled the spaces that until then had carried
the sounds of life from outside, into the inner council
chambers.</p>
<p class="western">Once all was sealed Vindec gathered them
together. He took the parchment on which the scribe was writing and
laid it onto the table top, flattening it gently with his hands.
The material stayed flat as though compressed by some great weight.
Lines of etching began to form on the hide, detailed, tiny copies
of the land formed, even down to the hovels on the outskirts of the
castle which were being rebuilt on the King's orders. A hay wagon
appeared in microscopic detail, and then the drawing expanded
covering the roads, the plains and finally reaching out to the
black road and its ruins.</p>
<p class="western">The tree with its plinth appeared, reminding
all present of what had taken place there. The King palled
slightly, but watched carefully as more detail filled out the fast
drawing map. Twin boulders sided the black road, permanent features
of lumpy rock which defined the point to which the battle had
closed. The Rock Trolls were immortalized forever within the
forming map as mighty rocks</p>
<p class="western">Vindec looked at each as they watched the
scroll transformed, seeking out concerns unspoken by any, seeing
only understanding on the faces of those that watched. The map
would be the chart which guided the plan, his plan and led onto the
creation of all that the magician sought. The map was a way to
ensure that all was created as it should be, no matter if an
accident was to befall him.</p>
<p class="western">"Come close and listen hard my friends,"
whispered Vindec, as he explained each phase of the construction
works that must be undertaken.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"And that is the point where the seal of
'Maorganith the witch' is created and filled out. Vindec tapped a
point at the maps center, as depicted by the diagrams that now
existed on the parchment. His plan was now laid bear for all to
see.</p>
<p class="western">Only Vindec in that room knew that what was
displayed, though important, was not what would ultimately be
required. In time he would lead these good men to the gate, which
shades the personal sacrifice that must occur for the benefit of
all. Only he understood that two of those present would be called
on to fulfill a destiny, a duty to time and place, and only they
could meet the challenge!</p>
