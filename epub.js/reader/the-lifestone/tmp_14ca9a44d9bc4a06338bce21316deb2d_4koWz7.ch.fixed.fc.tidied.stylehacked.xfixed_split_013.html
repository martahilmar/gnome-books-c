<p class="western">"Sire, Sire the voice called again, it was
only when a hand reached out to touch me, that I was drawn from my
revelry into the recent past. Forgotten, driven away by that
lightest of hesitant touches, was my dwarf. The reality of my
position returned.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire, the time has arrived, your orders
Sire, your orders, I beg of you!"</p>
<p class="western">The voice came from a slight creature, a
runner, eager to carry my instructions. Both that had been assigned
this most important of jobs were studying me, waiting for me to
speak.</p>
<p class="western">I looked out over the plain, seeing the mass
of Nailstead's creatures, all taking up close formation prior to
their attack. A glance upwards, revealed my flight of soldiers
eagerly waiting, all flying high in concentric circles above the
coming field of battle. Over the distant mountains a black cloud of
Nailstead's long necked, toothy creatures, did like wise. That
would be the cave dwellers that my dwarf had described.</p>
<p class="western">The time had arrived; I nod to my runners who
each depart, needing nothing more from me. I called to another, a
man sat at a mirror, saying to him.</p>
<p class="western">"Tell the Witch, that the time has arrived,
she may act as agreed when she believes the optimum opportunity has
arrived." He my signaler began flashing his mirror sending out
word.</p>
<p class="western">Far away, over yonder, and high up in her
cave home, I knew that the witch will be reacting to my signal. Her
coven she had split, some she prevailed upon to concentrate their
abilities upon my gathering troops, they were charged with keeping
in place the shield of invisibility. The remainder would be beside
her, circled and eager to fight directly with their magic
countering any attempt to influence the coming battle by the Dark
Lord himself; magic, both ancient would meet in a dual for survival
I thought, and I hoped that it would lead to a good outcome.</p>
<p class="western">I had done all that could be done, this is
the point that all generals know must come, the point of no return,
the point at which there is little if anything, that the said
general can do to influence the outcome of the engagement. He has
to watch and wait, hold his nerve and try to support the troops in
their upcoming struggle. I sat down, satisfied that I had done my
best, now like all of those others I could only wait and see the
outcome of all of my planning, and hoped for cunning to win the day
or lose it forever.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">My thoughts cloud over; I am once more drawn
from this field of glory back into my past, back to a certain room
within the distant Elvin castle. Back to the point in my young life
when this pathway had first been instigated. Until I had entered
that room with my co-ruler by my side, my boyhood friend Nailstead
the wise, as I liked to think of him. There had been no doubts in
my mind, that between us, we could and would rule this world,
providing and meeting the needs of all of our peoples together,
unified by friendship and deed.</p>
<p class="western">That all changed inside of the chamber as we
stood before the Council of Elders, listening to their assessment
of our plan to split the governing of our world. We had failed to
take into account the power attributed to the legends! We had
failed to convince those that needed convincing, and then their was
the Witch. She that had met, assessed and accepted me as the
rightful King. I remembered her always as the witch who would
continually guide me, starting as a young boy, leading me onward
throughout my life and into manhood; steering me always to take the
Crown. I was destined according to her to become the King of Kings.
She also foresaw and declared in me my right to be the True and
only King, no matter the lineage presented by others.</p>
<p class="western">She had proclaimed that I am and would be the
only true King, and with her proclamation my life changed, my
friendship had unknown to me then vanished, the possibility of ever
co-ruling with Nailstead had also vanished. Only life as the King
or a swift death remain to me; only one or other of us would
survive and the witch knew it. She separated us, drove a wedge
between us, and at the sametime saved my naive life at that
point.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead had realised the threat I presented
to his title, he had realised that to challenge my right to rule
would be pointless, the witch had decreed. His only option was to
ensure a speedy death for me. Then he will be reinstated as the
rightful ruler by dint of birth, where as I would have been shown
to be not the True King, by dint of my death, and the lack of the
immortality prophesied by the legends. The witch saved me from a
hidden dagger or a poisoned chalice, or any one of a thousand other
possible deaths. What she hadn't been able to save me from, was
standing on this battlefield, facing the creation of an army
designed by the now mature Nailstead. An army of evil intent of
dark nature set to attack and attempt to destroy all that stood
against it. That the all powerful witch had not been able by her
art to avoid, but then perhaps she had no desire to avert the
predicted war. A prediction that a boy King new nothing about and
so the years passed.</p>
<p class="western">Two years of being separate, but each equally
aware of everything that the other did, and then one day my page
had entered into my bed chamber. Guiding the witch, who unlike the
page failed to bow to me, something that in a slight way annoyed
me. Not because I like being bowed to by my visitors, but because
this was just one of the many ways that the witch showed her lack
of subjection to my royal self. Though at the sametime, I had to
accept that without her wisdom and guidance, I would not be the boy
King I was then, nor would I have lived to become the King I had
become with the passing of age.</p>
<p class="western">She dismissed my page without as much as a
nod towards me.</p>
<p class="western">"Get up boy!" Her words shattered the silence
of the room.</p>
<p class="western">I looked up from my bed that morning, feeling
slightly grumpy and tired from the nights before celebrations. I
had reached the age of true first man- hood yesterday, and a party
had been called for. Thirteen years of age and then my life had
become that of a true King. From then on, I would be the ruler of
this land, all would be subjected to my will, or so at that time I
believed. I was King Arthur, rightful ruler of the people, subject
to no-one, and this witch stood at my bedroom window, drawing back
the dark curtains, all unbidden by my royal self. Demanding that I
get up! Blast her to hell I thought, my head thumping with the
after effect of slightly too much dwarf ale.</p>
<p class="western">"Why should I?" I mumbled, not quite finding
my regal voice. She turned slightly, she stood slightly straighter,
and with a resolute and power filled voice, she spoke four simple
words to me, then turning away she waited for me to act. Those
words implied much, said much and demanded even more; for reasons
that I didn't fully understand, I found myself sitting up in my
bed, prior to getting out to attend next to her.</p>
<p class="western">Those four words still echo in my thoughts,
still contain a strange sort of power over me, but now I am a man,
a King and that power has fallen more under my command. Those words
replayed in my thoughts.</p>
<p class="western">"Because I demand it!"</p>
<p class="western">She, a witch demanded of the highest King of
Kings, the bearer of all the Royal Seals and I obeyed her, without
real understanding of how our roles were being reinforced by her
strength of will. It would be five more long years of learning for
me, before I had gained the full certainty of my status, at least
enough to reverse that situation enough to live with.</p>
<p class="western">The witch had retained control of a sort, but
now I have thoughts of my own, and the power to wield and act on
them, should I so wish or so dare to ignore her advice rather than
instruction. I remember that I climbed from my bed, I hastily
pulled on a gown to cover my night clothes, and went to stand by
her side. She pointed out of the window.</p>
<p class="western">"Look!" Was all she said with control.</p>
<p class="western">I looked, a dust cloud reared into the air,
someone was riding hard, pushing their horse to its limits. Heading
for the dark road down which I had walked. Destiny was being
defined right before my eyes, but I did not recognize it then. The
witch did, but she chose to tell me little other than what she
deemed necessary for me to understand at any time, the changing
situation she only pointed out.</p>
<p class="western">"That before you is the Dark Lord, that is
the boy who should have been King, that is the boy you by the dint
of prophesy and by my hand and guidance you have usurped."</p>
<p class="western">That she told me then as I looked out of the
window at the vanishing rider but nothing else that day did she
say.</p>
<p class="western">"That fast vanishing flicker, is Nailstead."
She stated clearly.</p>
<p class="western">I looked again, watching as the dust faded.
Nailstead was racing along the dark road having left the dust
tracks. He soon vanished into the mountain pass along which I am
told I walked, though I have no memory of so doing.</p>
<p class="western">"Good, well at least I can sleep well now
that he has gone!"</p>
<p class="western">She turned, fire flashing in her eyes to
glare at me, my thoughts turned to ice, I had spoken aloud what I
had been thinking, and now I realised, it was my words that had
angered her and far beyond my ability to understand.</p>
<p class="western">"He!" She spat out the word. "He will return,
and you will meet him out there, the world now hangs in the
balance. Remember that king of kings as you grow to rule, remember
this day for the rest of your life as it defines you and your
position in many ways."</p>
<p class="western">Her arm swung wide, encompassing all of the
distant expanse of the plain right up to the mountainous foot of
the towering border to my lands.</p>
<p class="western">"All this!"</p>
<p class="western">She turned inwards to face me.</p>
<p class="western">"All this that you believe so important will
be threatened, no man, woman or beast will be safe once he returns,
and he will return, mark my words! He is driven now, not for good.
He is driven by the insanity of his failure to ensure his
successful anointment."</p>
<p class="western">"He the boy Nailstead will grow to full
man-hood, knowing that all that should by rights have been his, has
now been snatched away from him, and given to another in his place.
There will be no room for pity in his black heart! No hope for
peace, or any restriction to his attempt to regain what he believes
to be his lost destiny."</p>
<p class="western">"You my present and future King will have to
face the snarling beast that he will become. You will have to
defeat him, kill him, put an end his dreams forever, or molder like
rotting bones, in a sea of destruction. You boy, you will be the
bridge between his desires, and our survival, the ramparts that
must stand tall and strong. And you talk as though his leaving is a
blessing! It is not a blessing in any disguise boy. Now, I hope
that you have a glimmer of understanding of the evil that has this
day been let loose upon this world."</p>
<p class="western">I could not look her in the face, instead I
turned my head to watch the plain wondering when he would return,
wondering if I would be able to withstand his bitterness. If the
witch was right, and I believed her implicitly, then someday, he
would return, and the reign of my kingship would be threatened, as
would be the safety of my people. I thought of the people, of the
mixture of human, elf and dwarf, of the cold hearted, but fiercely
loyal, and highly deadly flighted fighters, residing separately to
my other charges. High up there, across and in the very distant
mountains behind where I stood others would gather to resist my
reign. I thought of the water nymphs and gorgon's living beneath
our lakes surfaces, of the wild goats with their long horns,
leaping as I have been told that they leap, from rock ledge to
pencil thin barren cliff point.</p>
<p class="western">I thought of all of these and many more,
before I could look up into the face of the witch once more.
Determination filled my breast, the desire to fight for my people,
to sacrifice myself for their wellbeing. To die if necessary
bloomed in my chest. I hoped that the witch could see the light of
determination burning brightly in my eyes. She saw something, but
what she saw, she never said. Only I, I realised as I looked upon
her countenance felt a great sadness welling up in her. At a loss
to understand, I turned back to the window watching as the dust
faded back to the ground as my nemesis disappeared from my
life.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Whilst my thoughts had been drawn to my past,
my messengers had been traveling hard, they had each sought a point
a mile to left or right of my position, and there they had each
instigated the signal flash which declared the battle started.
Behind me the flash of light driven from a loosely mounted mirror
and aimed directly at the witches cave home, signaled her that the
engagement was about to commence. She in her turn blasted a single
rocket of red burning powder high into the air, to tower and
explode in a meteoric shower of coloured burning lights, clearly
seen by all on both sides of the coming battle, though understood I
hoped only by my own troops in waiting.</p>
<p class="western">That signal indicated to my troops that the
time had been chosen for them to abort their circling defensive
strategy, and it was a clear call to arms, for my flighted
warriors. High above me and out across the plain, the revelations
of my plan revealed themselves. Scores of concealed troops were
unveiled, revealed in their successful surrounding of the gathered
forces of Nailstead. Encircling them completely; all made ready for
the coming decimation. Behind them a column of mounted spear
bearers charged towards each other, they met, they formed up and
then they turned, not to face the coming battle, but outwards to
protect the vulnerable rear of my foot troops.</p>
<p class="western">High above my head flitting effortlessly in
the air might wings beat at the clouds, sending wave after wave of
arrow loosing troops into the fray. Nailstead's minions formed a
circle as their organized ranks disintegrated. Desperately spread
out before me, they attempted to regain the imperative, but failed.
Arrows slew them by their thousands. Yet thousands remained to
fight. The ground was now a litter of corpses, surrounded by
living, breathing, death deserving evil, all fighting hard against
my troops, as they tried to maneuver out of their entrapped
position.</p>
<p class="western">Behind the lines the mounted soldier's picked
of the very few that made a successful escape from my trap. This
day there would be no rout, no creature that had set foot on that
field of death would leave it with a semblance of life. Nailstead's
aerials attacked in force, charging into the fray on blackend
trusting wings, determined to free up their compatriots below, just
as I had expected them to do. From still higher up, hidden from all
sight by the clouds, a wave of yet more mounted archers swooped
down, locking onto the tails of the incoming enemy, cutting half of
them from the sky before they were even aware of the attacking
force. The air became a bloody death field, easily equal to the
plain below. Feathers, skin and arrow pierced flesh fell to the
distant floor, killing yet more of Nailstead's troops. The battle
looked to be going my way.</p>
