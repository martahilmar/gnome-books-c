<p class="western">Centuries pass during which the world of the
elves and dwarfs fade from sight, to be replaced by the rising of
humanity. Legends existing in the world of the King, became stories
told to children or written about as fantasy. The King's name still
lives, though many doubt the truth of his existence. Whilst all of
the changes occurred the King and his knights slept on safe and
protected by the Lifestone.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec lives through these changes, slowly
growing old but still holding on and always waiting for the call of
the Lifestone. Many times the King and his knights sallied fourth,
defending the true and honest, vanquishing the evil and demonic,
but these episodes failed to be understood by the rulers known as
man. With each battle fought, with each breakout from the abyss,
the King grew weaker, until finally he returned to the Olar and
failed to make it into the cavern. His body turned to stone and he
lay safely hidden in the accompaniment of the very few of his
surviving knights.</p>
<p class="western">The King has passed from life into shade, but
his entity lived on within the bounds of the Olar! Still as always
ready to defend the weak, and drive evil from his realm.</p>
<p class="western">The Lifestone took account of the situation,
it made arrangements for the future, it sought out humans to become
the Users of the King's power, the vessels which could carry the
entity of the true King out to battle against the dark forces, it
maintained the prophesies that had seen its creation.</p>
<p class="c1">The End.</p>
