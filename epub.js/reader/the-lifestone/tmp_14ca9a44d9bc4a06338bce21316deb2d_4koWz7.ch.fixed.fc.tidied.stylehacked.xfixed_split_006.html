<p class="western">The lone knight stood erect, his feet apart
and planted firmly; bright sunlight flashed off his gleaming
armour. His heavy sword was drawn but at rest held infront of him,
waiting, suppressed, eager to draw the enemy's blood. Alert but
relaxed the knight waited; he was surveying the distant land whilst
standing on top of the breastwork of an ancient, slowly decaying
wall of stone.</p>
<p class="western">Now, he thought. Now is the time of times.
Now is the doorway to glory and life, or else death and destruction
for all. He wondered exactly what he might be facing, he wondered
if as the legends of his world foretold, that he might yet still be
the victor, protector to his people, creator of an eternity of
peace. What an ambition he thought, as he carefully scanned the
flat arid ground before him.</p>
<p class="western">He had chosen the site of this the last
battle, at least he hoped it would be the last battle, it certainly
would be his final fling, for if he lost, his life would be
forfeit. The enemy would shatter his body as soon as look at it, if
they were able.</p>
<p class="western">For the last twenty years there had been a
continuing harassment of the people, small villages or even larger
towns had been raided by evil, that same evil now awaited him
somewhere out there. Many hundreds of his people had been decimated
and for what? For power, for 'The power'. Once his enemy had been
his friend and companion, trusted, and yes, even loved, he thought,
my boy-hood friend. Sharing the same home, even at times the same
room. Now he is my most bitter enemy, the nemesis of all decent
people.</p>
<p class="western">The bitterness had not been evident to him,
but it was unknowingly firmly established between them from their
first meeting. His arrival had started the process within the boy,
he had thought of as his true friend.</p>
<p class="western">When as a six year old child, he had walked
out of the sun onto the plains. There was no way that he could
understand that his very presence was the cause of the terrible
bitterness that would control and guide his future. He could not
then know that he had dethroned a future King, denying him of his
birthright, because of the power of a legend foretold of him as a
man. The boy would never seek out power, he had no driving ambition
to rule; for him, his friend could gladly have been the people's
leader. Unfortunately for him that could never be, the legends had
spoken and the interpretation been decided. The bitterness had
arrived that day as had he and it would establish the pathway of
his, and many other people's lives.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The long road down which he walked led past a
stone plinth surrounding a dead tree. Twin branches, both dead and
slowly rotting, extended outwards to either side, reaching to
nowhere. The trunk was swathed, encircled and hidden from sight,
amidst a thick covering of pointed sharp thorns. I, a child
destined to become a King, had stood at the road edge, drawn to
that tree but without understanding its meaning.</p>
<p class="western">I had encountered a lone soldier, who with
the intelligence of the Elvin people had decided that a child
walking safely out of the mountains was unusual enough, but a lone
male child walking out of the mountains, his path lit by the golden
rays of sunlight and standing by a grave marker, was even more
unusual, the guard had decided quickly. He had given me, the young
boy a drink and picking me up, had mounted his horse and carried me
his surprising find to the nearest town. Handing me over to the
proctor in charge, who just happened to be a very wise priest, one
who knew how to listen and then act on what he had heard.</p>
<p class="western">He of course knew the legends and therefore
the potential buried from sight in me, the boy he now held at his
mercy. He had called for his carriage and with all due haste he had
driven from the town; miles had passed beneath the rolling wheels
as the priest sought out his distant destination. The castle of
castles had been reached four and one half days later.</p>
<p class="western">The carriage had been admitted through the
first of the city's gates. Soon it had clattered up to a second
gate, this time we were not to pass through as easily as we had
through the first gate. The priest had pulled from within his tunic
a disk, on which was the image of two boys, one lit by the sun, the
other swathed in dark shadow.</p>
<p class="western">Seeing the talisman the guards had
immediately opened the second gate and waved us through. From
there, the path climbed still higher, until finally a third gate
was encountered. Again the disk was produced but this time not with
the same effect. These guards were not as easily swayed as their
predecessors had been, the priest talked for all that he was worth
and finally they agreed to send a runner. He would make haste to a
certain building within the highest pinnacle of the castle. The
runner was given a specific message to tell the reciprocator, he
was told to say that the 'boy was found'! The runner repeated the
rather strange message and departed at a fast run.</p>
<p class="western">For one hour we waited in the shadows of the
mighty walls, nothing happened, silence reigned, then from within
the last compound a loud voice could be heard shouting,</p>
<p class="western">"Let them in you fools, let them in now!"</p>
<p class="western">The gates opened and beyond them the priest
and myself, his charge could see the panting figure of a rotund
male, he was rushing towards us, his arms flapped as he
shouted.</p>
<p class="western">"Welcome, welcome guider of The One."</p>
<p class="western">Besides him ran another runner, his cloak
streaming out behind him, beyond, following close, were servants
and priests in a mixed jumble of panting, puffing and straining,
all with pumping legs and arms flailing at the air. Amazingly, the
knight who was now a King remembered, amazingly the oldest of the
group had arrived first; he had always wondered about that for
though he was very fat, the knight would learn that he had
boundless energy and also great intelligence.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">His priest reached out to the newly arrived
fat man and flung his arms around him, calling him brother, the
greeting was reciprocated and finally they parted, turning togther
towards me the rather bewildered looking boy.</p>
<p class="western">"So this is 'The One' this boy is what all
the fuss is about!"</p>
<p class="western">There was a smile of genuine excitement on
the face, which belied the content of the word that he spoke.</p>
<p class="western">"Well boy are you hungry? When I was your age
I was always hungry, come with us we can probably find something to
satisfy your young appetite."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The group as a whole turned and began to walk
back in the direction from which they had come. The boy found
himself between the two men. One, the fat one, placed his hand on
his young shoulders as if to guide or perhaps reassure him that all
was well, and would soon be even better. That at least was what the
boy hoped that the touch meant.</p>
<p class="western">The boy had not got a single memory of his
life before he had walked out of the mists, he didn't even know his
own name, the fat man kept referring to him as Arthur, the name had
a sound ring to it and felt all right. The name stuck and the
strange boy became known as Arthur to one and all that he
encountered. The legends had taken a step closer in the real world,
the boy Arthur knew nothing of those legends and would not do so
for many years, but the old fat man did and he was pleased that all
was going well. The future King had arrived, just as it had been
foretold. The only problem now was that the expected heir to the
title, the Boy Nailstead was about to be usurped by Arthur and that
would be problematic to the fat man. Something would have to be
done and he knew exactly what that something must be, the problem
was that he didn't like the thought of releasing even the slightest
grip he had on power to another.</p>
<p class="western">The person he had in mind, could, if she
complied, supply all of the answers to his problem, but on the
other hand she might disagree with his view and intent and then he
would be left mortally wounded and possibly frustratingly impotent
in the coming battle. This he decided would take some
consideration, before he decided whether to involve the witch, of
course he knew that at some point she would have to be involved,
but that would be a long time in the future, that was if he could
control both the pace and the power for good and evil contained in
events to come.</p>
