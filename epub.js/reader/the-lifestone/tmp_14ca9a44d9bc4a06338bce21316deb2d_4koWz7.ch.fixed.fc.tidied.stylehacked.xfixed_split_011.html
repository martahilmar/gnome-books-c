<p class="western">"Sire, as a young rather wayward dwarf, I
enjoyed the company of others and especially of my great uncle, a
tower guard. It was on one day in the full light, that I watched a
young boy escorted through the main gate. It was said that he was
the true King, word whispered around the traders, passed from them
to the populous; yet despite others claims, it is well known that
the word first formed amidst the guards."</p>
<p class="western">"I saw you as a bewildered child taking your
first steps to manhood and into your destiny. My great uncle told
me the gist of the legend that had linked you to that point in your
life. Later I talked with a certain soldier, the first to encounter
you as you had walked out of the sun, on that long dark road
heading out of the mountains and into your new life."</p>
<p class="western">"Sire, I became convinced that you alone were
to be the savior of our peoples, despite not knowing at that time,
that there was any form of threat to our safety. I decided that
very day that I would dedicate my services and abilities to the
protection of and serving of you. It came to pass some years later,
that one day whilst I was serving duty as a palace guard, much like
my great uncle, and my father and his father and his father before
him, stretching back in time as far as is known. That I encountered
a certain minister of your court; he was seeking a brave soldier
with woodsman's experience to serve you in a dangerous
mission."</p>
<p class="western">"I have always shunned living in the castle,
I have always chosen to follow the dwarfish trait of living out
world, hence I am self-sufficient enough to survive, and hardy
enough not to require the luxuries of roof or bed. I stepped
forward that day and volunteered. Nothing was said, my rank and
position was noted by your emissary, my experience was added to his
notations and then he left. I heard nothing until nearly a full
rotation had passed and I was summoned before not the minister but
before you my King!"</p>
<p class="western">"To say that I was shocked, which is not an
easy thing to do to me, would be to say that rain falls upward into
the sky, something that is possible I believe, but little known.
That day you entrusted a most secret challenge." He the dwarf
looked up at me, as I, his King looked across at him. The dwarf and
I, as King and servant shared a mutual secret. I remembered the
meeting her referred to quite clearly, and also the fear I felt at
the possibility of his impending mission's failure. I also remember
the feeling in my bones and guts at the greater fear, if his
mission were to be successful, a success, but one destined to carry
the wrong news to my ears.</p>
<p class="western">I nodded telling him with a slight wave of my
hand to continue his tale. Not only do I remember clearly his
presentation to me, but I also remember equally as clearly, the two
other people, one elfin the other human that had individually been
selected. I remember my deep feelings of fear for them all, of
wishing to link them together, to tell one of the other etc, but
there was the council's decision and advice to separate and keep
them each in the dark. They reasoned that if all three returned
with information, it could be cross checked, one against the other.
The same for two returning, alas if only one came home, his
information would have to be taken at face value, but never the
less, it would offer values.</p>
<p class="western">The council convinced me to agree with their
plan with their last resort of reasoning. Should one of the three
be captured and forced to talk, they could not uncover the
existence of the other two interlopers, because they would not know
anything of them. So it had been; three had been carefully
selected. Three were chosen, each the most suitable, each skilled
and deemed to be the most capable of representing their species,
which together formed the people of this our world. Before me now
sat the only returnee so far, the single dwarf, a brave creature
with a tale to tell, a tale I most desperately needed to hear,
despite not wanting to have to acknowledge its content. For to
listen, understand and accept his words, brought my people one step
closer to all out war and would make the evil lurking on the
fringes of my kingdom all the more real.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf sat slightly and more upright in
his chair. He raised his head, took a deep breath and continued
with his tale.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"With the honor of serving your desires and
the obvious importance of the mission you had entrusted me with, it
was decided that I should leave the castle a few days later, that I
should profess to be bored and taking my due rest time. I went to a
lot of trouble instilling the belief that I was intending to visit
pastures new and live out of communication with others, in the
field."</p>
<p class="western">"Most everyone accepted my statements at
plain sight, though I am not absolutely certain that my uncle was
one of them, he is trusted totally by me. I suspect his knowledge
only because, prior to my professed trip being commenced, he
approached me and gifted a long time family cloak, and a newly
sharpened, but very old dagger for my belt. A dagger, Sire, makes
for a poor tool for skinning a catch, it being designed to pierce
flesh with a lunge and to kill, rather than cut with its blade. He,
my uncle patted my shoulder, smiled into my face and wished me safe
passage."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">'Wise uncle', I thought, hoping that his
wisdom did not threaten my plan. I waved the dwarf on; this could
take long enough without the breaks, let alone with them, dwarves
are not known for being concise but they are always detailed and
accurate, so in the end I would know all that he presently
knew.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I left and headed out towards the rough
lands, out behind the castle, making very sure that I was not
followed, I wasn't of that you can be sure Sire! Once I deemed that
I had traveled far enough from the castle, I began circling it, two
days later the dark road was to my left and I was heading across
the plain. That is the part that concerned me most up to that
point."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">I nodded realising the threat of discovery my
dwarf had been under, any passing guard could have intercepted him
and at that point. Only dark minions and those up to no good would
be heading out of our lands, towards and into the mountains. Of
course precautions had been put in place to ensure that if stopped
and questioned, the dwarf would be speedily released, those
precautions I knew all about, because I had personally signed the
letter he was carrying, in preparation to dispatching him. It
informed whoever, that this dwarf was on the King's business and
not to be harried or delayed, under pain of sever consequences. No
such consequences would befall any that did interfere, as they
would, after all, be only performing their duty, but the mere
threat should suffice. Apparently the dwarf's skills exceeded my
guard's skills, something I would have to look into, but for now I
needed his information.</p>
<p class="western">"Please good dwarf continue," I bid him,
feeling impatient with the delay but hiding it well. He lowered his
bearded face, slightly hesitating, as though ordering his thoughts,
and then he did exactly as I had bidden him do, he started to talk
again.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Prior to my having departed I took the time
to hunt amongst the taverns, listening to the gossip and the tall
tales that traders always enjoy telling. Most of what I overheard
in that three days, could be safely called garbage, being piss and
wind to the story teller. Still Sire, there was one snippet of
information which seemed to me to have been elicited though third
hand, from someone that might know the truth of what they spoke. It
was following this snippet that caused me to cross the plain to the
far right of the road. It was that snippet, which was to prove
accurate to a useable degree, and was to lead me to a narrow chasm.
A deep narrow cleft cut deep into the rock of the mountain, which
once followed, then climbed and carried me deep into the mountains
and offering me the most secretive of entry points into the
bargain, it was that route that I followed."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">I sat more upright in my chair looking at the
dwarf, so, I realised, he had indeed carried out my instructions
and lived to return and tell his tale. A passage or crack in a rock
face, who would have thought it; learned about through gossip over
beer, words of wisdom spilled and gathered in from loose tongues
and old wives tales, and in a tavern of all places! I would never
have thought to seek secretive information from the traders; they
generally are nothing but mercenary vagabond travelers, feeding
their greed and desires out of the pockets of others. Still this
dwarf had thought of doing just that, and he had been successful.
Perhaps I would have to treat the traders with a bit more concern
from now on. They might equally be supplying our enemies with
intelligence and information, unwittingly of course, but deadly all
the same.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Once I had followed the crevice upwards from
our plain I entered into the mountains properly, the ground showed
signs of water having passed along it, so I realised that my secret
crevice was infact a water course, a drain for the high peaks above
me. I hoped that it did not rain for a while, the thought of being
swept right back to the plain, a tumbling battered dwarf, to be
cast outwards and die from my injuries was not appealing to me. A
regular glance at the skies reassured me of a dry passage, much I
might say to my relief."</p>
<p class="western">"Two days I trudged on, ever upwards, seeing
little but rock to right and left and sky above. My passage way
ended abruptly, I rounded one of the many twists and there it was,
a wall of rock, worn so smooth as to be un-climbable, I thanked my
uncle at that point greatly, because without his foresight and
gifts, I would have been left with no option but to about turn and
try to penetrate the mountains by another route, as it was I leapt
the face and continued onward. Possibly I might have been forced to
take the black road, a route which I was sure was being watched
constantly by Nailstead's forces. Such a route offered me little
likelihood of a safe passage, and little to no likelihood of ever
returning if entry were to be made along its dark way."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">I nodded, listening to the dwarf, but
thinking of two others that had attempted similar entry on my
command, and thinking that neither of them had so far returned. The
elf had passed along that dangerous road; I know that much of his
trip, because I had seen him off, in the company of a troop of my
guards. That troop had returned stating that the elf had vanished
into the darker road and the mountains. When they had said
vanished, they meant exactly that! The sergeant of the guard told
me that one second the elf had been mounted and riding by his side,
the next he had looked across and the elf had vanished.</p>
<p class="western">They had stopped, hunting around the area
incase some accident had befallen the elf, but no trace of him or
his passing had been discovered. Though he admitted, one of his
hunting troops had reported a flash of light from higher up the
hillside. The sergeant decided and rightly I believed, at that
point to pull his troops back, there was nothing else that he or
they could do, but wish the missing elf well and return to their
barracks.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"At that point Sire, I knew nothing of your
other incumbent, I was traveling deeper into the mountains and
eventually I found myself facing a wall of fine looking timber. If
it could be managed and harvested properly it could even make the
stone heart of a hardened trader gladden. Anyways, I entered the
wood and that was the beginning of my down fall. Until then I had
seen nothing and no one, infact I was beginning to get slightly
overconfident. I, I was as I traipsed my way through, and around,
tree after tree seeing nothing with any life, getting
overconfident."</p>
<p class="western">"How I missed it I will never know, but miss
it I did! I walked forwards stepping over the outer rope into the
center of a concealed net and I never even knew it was there sire,
until it sprung. It lifted me high up and at the same time
inverting me. The net closed tight around my arms and locked my
legs together and left me hanging there like a plucked turkey, all
ready for the pot. Now in my defense Sire, I have to say that the
job was well conceived, the net had been perfectly placed, but
still I was lax, an got myself bloody well strung up!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The dwarves language had slipped slightly
with his distress at regaling to me his error, an error that might
well have destroyed any hope of his completing his mission. Still
he was sitting infront of me, so somehow he had managed to recover
the initiative and continue on, how, was now the question? There
was also the reference to my missing elfin investigator to be
explained, how had my dwarf encountered my elf? Under what strange
circumstances had they met, and in what state had they each parted,
and for that matter, I wondered. What of my third and seemingly
unknown about spy, the first I had sent out, the most trusted of
humans. Where was he, was he dead or alive, would he be returning
to me or had he become but a brief memory, lost to me and this my
world? Only the dwarf sat infront of me might know the answers to
my worrying questions, and if I didn't hurry him up then valuable
time would be lost, time that would only benefit the dark lord, my
nemesis, Nailstead.</p>
<p class="western">"Continue good Sir." Now I'm getting all
formal but it worked, the dwarf began talking once more.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I was hung there for only a few seconds,
certainly not enough time to maneuver myself free, when from all
around me humans appeared, though not humans as you might think of
them. One in particular drew my attention him being both the
largest man creature I have ever seen, and also it being obvious
that he was in charge of this hunting party, which had snared me.
Shortly they had released the net, depositing me hard on the floor
accompanied by a loud splat and some prolific cursing from me I
might add."</p>
<p class="western">"It is a good job that we dwarves are tough,
if it had been for instance a man that was deposited, he might well
have broken every bone in his body, but me, I was just a little
bruised and slightly winded and very annoyed mostly at myself I
might add. They were taking no chance; before I could sit up I was
surrounded, and held down at spear point. The tall one stepped
through the wall of points looking down at me. My first impression
of him had been that he stood taller than his comrades was
confirmed, but his height was mostly in his legs, them being far
out of proportion to his torso making him look at least quite odd
to my eyes, if not very strange."</p>
<p class="western">"He held a knife loosely in his left hand,
though I would wager that it would quickly slice my throat to the
bone, were I to threaten him in anyway. His arm extended, not the
one with the knife, but the other one. Which was when I realised
that his arms were wrong as well! This creature was deformed, and
there is no other way about it to describe him. I looked into his
eyes, not knowing what to expect, perhaps insanity or malice.
Neither were present, only a look of serenity, of a job well done
filled them, I do not believe that he held me any ill will, but
equally, I am certain he would have killed me where I lay if he
thought it right. Luckily for me he decided that I would make a
better prisoner, than corpse."</p>
<p class="western">"His compatriots bound me hand and foot to a
pole, then with me dangling like so much meat, they hoisted me to
their shoulders, it took four of them to do so, then with him in
the lead we all marched off, to where, I didn't know, but Sire, I
am not ashamed to admit, I was a tad scared of the where we were
going, as I was certain sure it would do me know good."</p>
<p class="western">"They carried my bound to that pole for three
uncomfortable days in total, days during which they had to
continually rotate my carriers, as I am not the lightest of
dwarves. That gave me a good chance to study the band into whose
hands I had fallen. They were an odd assortment, mostly what you
would refer to as vagabonds, being mostly dirty and disheveled.
Their weapons, mostly bows and short knives didn't look to be in
much better condition to me, than they themselves were."</p>
<p class="western">"The second day they halted to make camp, and
they even had the decency to feed me, though I suspected that they
only did that to ensure that I was in prime condition to be
presented to who, or whatever, we were going to meet. I ate,
trusting to my belief that they needed me alive, ignoring the
possibility that the food might be poisoned, as I reasoned they
could kill me at anytime if they wanted, and without the pretense
of poisoning me, so I ate their food and even drank a little wine,
when it was offered. The water, when offered I ignored, it was
brackish, not very good as water goes, fit only for washing,
something most of them were obviously not accustomed too."</p>
<p class="western">"Had I been tracking them, rather than being
carried along as their prisoner, I would have been able to follow
them by their scent alone, which of course added to my distress at
being so easily caught. Why hadn't I smelt them? After some serious
though, I realised that they had been clever enough to hide
themselves up wind of their trap, an patient enough to wait!"</p>
<p class="western">"Anyways Sire, that set me to thinking and
the thought was most enlightening, assuming that they had laid the
trap and moved away to wait. The question I had to answer was why
there, what made them so sure that there would be something like
me, alone and walking along that trail to snare, was it luck or
judgment? Now I know that I hadn't been followed, and I know that
nobody had known that I was going that way, except for you Sire,
and that line of thought was ridiculous. So the question stood, how
did they know that I was coming, because I learnt by listening to
them, that they had expected a dwarf along any day, and then up I
pops and neatly steps into their trap, all eager like to get's
myself caught."</p>
<p class="western">"Obviously they had been informed, but by
who, why and when? The question began to burn in my mind and I
determined to get to the bottom of it. During the halt and camp,
whilst they were feeding me I tried to elicit some clue to their
reasoning. Unfortunately the skinny spider man noticed my talking
to one of them and came over, dismissing my attendant. He stood
looking around the camp then calling out; at the top of his voice I
might add and it was a loud carrying voice. He told everyone quite
clearly, that no one but him was to say so much as a single word to
me!"</p>
<p class="western">"To my surprise he squatted down next to me,
his knees bent uppermost and twisting outwards, reaching nearly
level with his shoulders! He had a knife in his hand, not cheap or
poorly maintained like most of the weapons I had previously seen.
No, his was all shiny and gleaming, with a deep cutting edge,
tapering to a sharp point, even the blood gutting channel was
polished and shone. He looked into my eyes then asked me what I had
been talking to his man about? Seeing no sense in lying to him, not
just because of the knives presence, but because he was now the
only source of information left open to me. I told him. He nodded,
understanding my dilemma, then to my eternal amazement, he told me
that he had been sent to lay the trap, and had been informed that I
was on my way."</p>
<p class="western">"His superiors it seemed, the higher ones had
informed him of the where, but not the how or why. Camp gossip
though had suggested a possible answerer to the source and he had
been interested enough to listen to it. Four days previously, he
had told me, a human had been caught, a hunter judging by his
clothing and the proliferation of weapons he was carrying. It was
reasoned that if there was one, there might be more, and that was
the answer, simple, lucky, but pure chance. A human, I wondered
what had happened to him, my capturer didn't know, but the look on
his face left me in no uncertainty that it probably wasn't good,
especially for the human."</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The King looked up from the wine goblet he
had been studying whilst listening to the dwarf's tale, something
about what he had just heard, troubled him.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf was sitting upright in his chair,
silent now, studying me, waiting for something. It clicked in to
place, the dwarf had said that the Spider man had told him that a
human had been caught, and logic had led them to the dwarf. It made
no sense, how could they have been expecting a dwarf, if deduction
was all they had to go on? There was just no way that the spider
mans version could be true. Whether he had deliberately lied to the
dwarf, or he had been misled by his own superiors was debatable.
Yet the fact of their expecting a dwarf and knowing approximately,
but not exactly, both when and where to find him, made little sense
if the spider man was to be believed.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf was still watching me as I reasoned
through his story, picking out the bits that didn't tally. He knew,
I realised, he, like me, had made the connections and realised that
he was being told only a part of the truth. I smiled at him; I
certainly had chosen the wiliest dwarf to send out as my scout. So
they had caught or found a human, must be caught, not found, as
they could not get information out of a corpse. So they caught my
human emissary, and the dwarf knew about the elf as well, that much
I knew already. This tale was beginning to get confusing.</p>
