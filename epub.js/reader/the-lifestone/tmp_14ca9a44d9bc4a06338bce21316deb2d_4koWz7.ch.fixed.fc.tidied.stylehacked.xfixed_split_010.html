<p class="western">The time finally had arrived, Nailstead's
army had fully entered the field of battle, they crawled, ran or
slithered their bellies mostly held close to the ground. There were
some that even hopped moving forward on deformed legs towards my
meager looking defenses, in anticipation of blood letting and the
victory promised to them by Nailstead the dark one. They had been
lulled, I believed by the few soldiers dug in ready that apparently
awaited them. The army, my army rallied, preparing itself for the
desperate assault to come, an assault that it alone would have to
rebuff. I climbed down from my rock plinth, now hidden from sight
by the bricks that made up its wall.</p>
<p class="western">To my left a creature with wings and a large
hooked beak flapped idly at the air, eager to carry its message to
the Dwarf army hidden out there to the right. Equally, an identical
messenger waited to my left, but a bit more patient, an older bird,
that was obvious by its plumage displaying its faded colours, but
with a wiser more experienced head on it shoulders, it also awaited
my command. A command that would send both flying to left and right
of the field of slaughter. The bird to my left was charged with
informing Iffilditch, leader of the Elves, whilst its companion
would inform the dwarves that the time was arrived, that the battle
long waited for could be commenced.</p>
<p class="western">Slowly I approached the wall lifting my head
slightly above its rough parapet of bricks, watching the stalking
creatures, seeing only confidence in them as they approached my
visible army. My few buried troops, hidden beneath a light coating
of dust spread over capes waited, they would rise as one and fire
their bows directly into the first ranks of the enemy. Behind them
hidden in any cavity or cover they could locate, waited a second
and third rank of archers. Horse mounted humans, armed with long
steel tipped spears, were hidden in the ruins behind where I stood,
they would charge through the archers, spearing into the remaining
wall of creatures. Acting as a defense for the first rank of
archers, allowing them to retreat and regroup with their comrades,
who would be lob firing arrows as fast as they could, arrows which
would fly high and long to pierce deep into the attacking ranks
forming a trapping wall of dead behind those that had passed
forward and were trapped between fire.</p>
<p class="western">Young boys and elves would be carrying fletch
after fletch forward to the archers, keeping them supplied,
hopefully allowing them to fell rank after rank of the enemy, thus
slowing and eventually containing them. Then mounted riders would
hack their way back to our lines in a sweeping curve, rallying for
another charge as necessary behind the solidly formed line of
archers. The enemy would close but only so far, they would
retaliate, probably with arrows and spears, many of my defenders
would die this day, but still they must hold at all costs.</p>
<p class="western">Once our enemies' forces were engaged, to
left and right troops would infiltrate and encircle the battle
beleaguered forces, cutting them off from the mountains and any
hope of escape. Our aerial forces would target ground troops and
engage airborne evil, as and where they could. They would also act
as lookouts for the encircling troops, and at the right moment
release a flair of dense black smoke, signaling the time for full
engagement.</p>
<p class="western">That would be the turning point I hoped; it
would also be the moment of greatest risk. The danger to my plan
lay in the possibility of not having all of Nailstead's forces
drawn out and encircled on the field. There was a potential to have
my two waves of troops, having to fight both forwards and backwards
against one opposing army that had been split into two. My thoughts
turned to a single battle weary Dwarf and the report that he had
presented to me three days earlier.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Sire."</p>
<p class="western">The page bowed low, a habit, that no matter
how much I instructed him not to, he could not help himself from
doing. He looked excited, much as I now felt. I had viewed the
arrival of a dust covered, tired looking dwarf. I had stood
watching his path as he had crossed the green sward, which
surrounds this, my mountain top castle. I had seen him passed
quickly through the first of the gates, where once entered in, he
vanished from my sight.</p>
<p class="western">Could it be a full month since I had summoned
him to me and given him a challenge to complete, a challenge which
might prove to provide the pivotal information I would need to wage
a successful war against Nailstead. Stepping away from the window I
planned our meeting out in my mind, deep down I felt a growing bout
of concern, what news would this brave dwarf bear, what assessments
would he have made, if any, I thought, plucking at my chin,
wondering.</p>
<p class="western">I ordered the page to fetch mulled beer,
adding. "The best we have, this chap deserves at least that for
what he has accomplished, if only for returning to us alive!"</p>
<p class="western">My page bowed low, I must stop that, and left
me, returning shortly with a flagon mug and a full Crone, which is
a dwarf measure made especially for beer. It equates to
approximately half a human gallon, dwarves drink heavily but
without effect, something that I envy them for being able to do.
They also fight and travel, far faster and far harder than men,
though not as quickly as elves. Dwarves can appear cumbersome,
slow, even dim of wit but they are far from being any of those
things. Many battles have been won just because of the presence of
dwarves and I think this coming war with Nailstead may well be
another such battle.</p>
<p class="western">It took nearly half an hour for the dwarf to
be brought to my door, my page entered first to announce him, he
then stood aside before leaving and closing the door behind the
dwarf. He as was his way stood nonchalantly gnawing on a haunch of
freshly cooked meat, seemingly unaware of my presence.</p>
<p class="western">"Welcome, welcome, sit, relax, you look done
in, are you ok?" A stupid question really, considering how
exhausted he looked. I poured a tankard of beer placing it infront
of him. "I see they fed you."</p>
<p class="western">"Call this fed, it is but a light snack!" He
expounded, hardly a morsel fit for a dwarf to call a meal.</p>
<p class="western">Typical of his species, bluff and
independent, but loyal beyond measure.</p>
<p class="western">"As for how I is, well I arn't shot full of
holes, an ifen you don't count the cut on this arm."</p>
<p class="western">He lifted his right arm to show the blood
soaked, dust encrusted bandage tied around his wrist.</p>
<p class="western">"Then you could say that I is all-right!"</p>
<p class="western">"Glad to hear it dwarf, and all the more
pleased to see you safely returned.</p>
<p class="western">"Thank in you Sire, I is most grateful for
your concern and more appreciative for the beer!" He said waving
the haunch of half eaten meat in the air around him.</p>
<p class="western">"Any a ways, I ain't here to talk about the
weather or me' elf, I guess you might like to know what I
discovered, seeing as that was why you sent me and the others out
to the mountains and beyond."</p>
<p class="western">'The others', he had said, how did he know
that there were others? I had sent three people out to scout, one
of each species that made up my people; this dwarf so far was the
only one to have returned, as to the others, I am very concerned
for them. Now the dwarf talks of them as thought he knows something
of their fate.</p>
<p class="western">I know dwarves quite well, as a child and
into my formative years I chose their company; it was a dwarf that
first taught me the art of self-defense, or 'dwarf tossing' as they
call it. It was a dwarf that showed me the intricacies of a variety
of weapons. I know them and I respect them, but I also know that
they have their own way, a historic way, a way of telling a tale or
giving a report and nothing will encourage them to speak out in any
other way.</p>
<p class="western">This dwarf before me, would be no different,
he would grant me his words in a tale, a story of his deeds and
happenings without bluster or self aggrandizement. A dwarf tale can
be taken wholly as true and accurate, they make for very poor
liars, because of this tale telling, which is all to the good, but
it can be frustrating at times. I sat myself comfortably, picked up
my glass of elf wine, and readied myself for the tale to come.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf having finished his meat, downed
his beer, then sat up straight, he placed his arms firmly on the
chairs arms, he took in a single deep breath and began his story
and what a tale it was to be.</p>
