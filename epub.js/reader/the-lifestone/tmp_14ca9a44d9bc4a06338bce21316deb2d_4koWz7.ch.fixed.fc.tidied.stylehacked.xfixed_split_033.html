<p class="western">Vindec turned away from the long hall and
walked from the new and final resting place of the Lifestone. All
around him life grew, the ground moved beneath his feet as the
stone reached out to its home, defining, altering, and creating the
land within its realm. The Lifestone also reached out to Vindec,
with the voice of she, which echoed in his thoughts, confirming his
belief and wishing him well in his life. He passed between the twin
guardians, then through the only remaining exit from the circle. He
walked on a ways before turning to look back over what he had
created.</p>
<p class="western">Where there had been a ring of soil there now
was growth. The ground swelled as root after root of snake like
vines burst from within. Trees unplanted grew, filling out the
inner space, within but unseen, new pathways formed each leading to
somewhere, but never to be walked by him again, he understood.
Vindec would be welcomed only once more into the circle until then
his life would pass in waiting, in watching, in helping his King.
Eventually even that duty would change, but that would be far into
the future and not to be considered now, even by him.</p>
<p class="western">He turned towards the distant Elvin castle,
he has a meeting at midday with the council, but first he needs to
plant the seeds of knowledge in the mind of the one that it will
most affect. He spread his arms out, reaching with his mind for the
sky, and with a single beat of his outstretched wings Vindec took
off. Leaving the ground below him, bursting upwards into the air;
to any that saw him he appeared to be a large eagle, soaring high
into the sky, few if any saw him, but Vindec with the sight of an
eagle saw all below him. Including the growth of the vines, which
grew incredibly, already in just a few minutes the vines had taken
control of the ground and covered it.</p>
<p class="western">Dark tipped thorns were forming already, each
a deadly barrier to any foolish enough to enter. The entry guarded
by the sentinels remained clear of the vines; only once the last of
the black road was put in place would the vines conquer that narrow
gap as well. The trees grew a foot as he watched, by the time this
day was complete the area would be unrecognizable and fully
protected. All that remained was for the prophesy to be completed,
and that was close, as close as a few wing beats, as close as a
will born idea. The one he sought waited, but without knowing that
he waited for the magician to arrive, unknowing that he waited for
his life to be changed forever! Destiny calls on feathered
wings...</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Vindec explained, the King listened; sitting
in his office chair facing the magician, fingering the sliver of
stone that had so far save his life or so he had believed. Now came
the news, the demand for his service, the future was clear he
understood, but he found it hard to accept. Vindec looked at his
King knowing that what he was demanding of this fairly young man
was much to ask, but also knowing that the King had no other option
other than to accept. The prophesies assured him of that, all that
remained was for King Arthur to accept the duty and its
challenges.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec left the King; he called into visit
with certain members of the elf world, then he sought out one
dwarf. He was an elderly dwarf, well respected but equally
temperamental, but his skill in the working of metal was
incomparable. They talked, and finally Vindec departed.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The council chambers were full, seats
previously unoccupied were filled, the council sits in all its
august majesty. The King entered a look on his face of calm ordered
thought. He nodded to his ministers and took his place between his
twin leaders of the council. Iffilditch watched, wondering at the
look of peace that emanated from the King, as he glanced at the
silent, still Vindec, knowing on some level; that this meeting
would not be like so many others.</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch at a nod from the King silenced
the room; a feeling of expectation flooded the space, emanating
from the council benches, outward through the gathered and still
further. All could feel the magic in the air, all realised that
this meeting had been called for a good reason. All present
understood that they the representatives of all races had been
gathered, not for the dealing with of mundane affairs but for a
serious matter of state. They sit as bidden, in silence now,
waiting; some even holding their breath, others clutching their own
hands, all wondering at what they are about to hear.</p>
