<p class="western">Nailstead's forces were closing fast on my
defenses; I looked back towards the mountains wondering what the
witch is doing, desperately wishing to be able to see. I understood
the processes she is melding; I could picture her standing before
the glowing crystal with her minions surrounding her, perhaps
chanting ancient verse, perhaps not. I imagined her reaching out
and into the Lifestone, taking it, and molding it, using its
unadulterated power to fulfill her and my ambition.</p>
<p class="western">The stone is ancient, one of the few, if only
remaining stones of power, I remember how, just being in its
presence had driven fear both out of me and into me at the
sametime, creating in me a feeling of confusion which had also
terrified me as a small boy. It still terrified me now, but
differently. The witch had decreed to me and the Council that the
stone might protect us all by defeating Nailstead, or it might
decide that we were unworthy of its assistance and crush us from
this world. Taking the risk and agreeing to allow the stone to be
called upon had been a long debate.</p>
<p class="western">Most of the Council supported the idea, four
did not, I remained neutral not having a direct vote in Council.
Finally it had been decided that the stone could, should, be used,
the threat against our civilized life was such that defeat by
Nailstead was intolerable. The council decided that it was better
to be wiped from existence, than to be enslaved in the mire of a
dark evil. The witch had knelt before the Council neither agreeing
nor disagreeing with its desires, only accepting the outcome of the
vote. I watched her bow her head before the Council then turn to
face me. I felt, I remember it clearly, like the little boy in her
cave home once more, feeling her power as her eyes sought out
mine.</p>
<p class="western">There is something about the witch's eyes
that is always unnerving, they imply that she can see deep into a
man, look at his heart and understand the things kept hidden
within. The studied man feels as though she can understand all that
drives him, that all that he might desire to remain hidden is seen
by her clearly. I met her stare that day, hoping that she would see
naught but genuine goodwill in my presence. She bowed her head
ending her contact, having received her unasked for answer, to an
unaskable question. The witch stood, bowed before the Council,
which comprised of mostly older wise men of the city.</p>
<p class="western">She showed them respect for their ability and
wisdom but not for their combined ancient age. The witch it is said
is far older than any and all of the Council men's ages combined,
she is a remnant of a darker past but one turned to the light. She,
or so it is said, is intrinsically good, but somewhere deep in my
thoughts I wonder, could one previously so enmeshed in dark history
really be a defender of the new light civilizations? I wonder if
she has desires of her own for my world, or is she genuinely free
from lingering dark deeds carried out in the mists of a time long
past? I, like the Council, will have to trust to her, so far she
had done nothing to dissuade my belief in placing that trust in
her, I just hope that it will remain so.</p>
<p class="western">The witch departed to weave her arcane
spells, the Council began to quarrel and bicker amongst themselves,
I decided that I had no part in the ongoing affairs of the Council,
it was their job to serve the needs of the peoples, not mine; as
King and final arbiter of their decisions only because of my
ultimate role did I departed from that room.</p>
<p class="western">It was from that room I remembered, my memory
flicking from one place to another, that I had returned and awaited
the imminent arrival of my dwarf and listened to the tale he had
regaled me with.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Sire, had said my dwarf; I hid beneath my
cloak, invisible to the guards as the wagon passed between the now
fully removed barriers, being driven forward by an oxen team, with
the whip held firmly in the hand of a human. I could only reason
that he was there to meet some warped ideological desires, or
perhaps he was simply driven by plain greed! Know matter the
reasons sire, he, the driver, was assisting the minions of the dark
one in his campaign. What he hoped to gain from such a liaison I
could not see? Surely he realised that his life would be forfeit if
discovered as a collaborator, and if he remained undiscovered, then
his life would have become as nothing to the evil that would take
over our lands. As far as I could determine he was plain ignorant
or just insane or both!"</p>
<p class="western">"I stayed hidden for an hour or more allowing
the slow pace of the oxen to pull the wagon further from the
encampment. Eventually my dwarf nosiness took the better of me, so
I carefully lifted my head from beneath my cape. I had not needed
to be careful it turned out, the guards had dropped the back canvas
back into place, and it flapped back and forwards with the
lumbering jerky swaying gate of the beasts up front doing all the
work. The wagon's inside was bare, its innards stripped of goods,
only containing the basic needs of the wagon driver, and those were
equal only to the most primitive life style."</p>
<p class="western">"I could see deep cut gouges in the flooring
and others in the wagon's wooden sides. This space must have been
filled to its maximum on the outwards trip, the gouges being cut as
the load shifted in time with the rocking clop of the oxen. Now all
it carried was I, alone in the empty back and him, the traitor sat
up front ignorant of my presence. Soon I would be forced to make a
decision; I would either have to leave the wagon undetected and
proceed on foot, or deal with the traitor and take his
vehicle."</p>
<p class="western">"Why? I can almost hear you thinking Sire.
Well it seemed to me that sometime, and probably shortly, the
driver would stop and camp out for the night, which meant that he
would open up the wagon back and enter. Good a camouflage as my
cape provided, it cannot hide me in such close confines, so I would
be discovered. That held the risk that the driver would have chosen
to encamp near to a group of Nailstead's minions, which meant that
discovery and recapture were very real possibilities, and that I
could not allow to happen. I was certain that if I was captured
again, that I would not escape again quite so easily. Faced with
the choice of flight or assassination I decided, that to wait for a
short while was still a good third option."</p>
<p class="western">"I carefully opened the rear flap to see how
far and in what direction the wagon was rolling. Outside in the
distance rose the mountains with their flighted beasts, mostly
hidden from sight but ever lurking, waiting, stationary but alert
in their dark caverns. Up front I could hear the driver gently
encouraging his team of oxen to pull harder. I was being carried
across the plain, soon I reckoned we would be entering into
woodland, there would be the place to decide, and also the place to
attack or depart with the best option of success. I would just have
to be patient for a while and see what happened."</p>
<p class="western">"The wagon turned slightly drawing to a halt,
I risked another glace out the rear, noting the dense trees,
listening hard, I thought I detected the sounds of a crackling
fire, though nothing else. No cheery greeting to a like minded
traveler, just the crackling of slightly damp firewood.
Unfortunately that implied an encampment, which in turn implied
company, and any company that my driver might choose to bivouac
with, would be far from the company I might choose, so my departure
became an essential."</p>
<p class="western">"Stealing the wagon and driving placidly
towards home was no longer going to be an option, unless I thought,
I depart into the woods, and lurked around through the night,
intent on following the wagon when it departed and captured it
further on. There were a number of very interesting questions that
I would not enjoy asking, but needed to put to my driver, he would
not enjoy providing me with the answers I required, but I knew that
he probably would give them to me quickly, with or after some
suitable persuasion. If he didn't, then it would be off to the
King's dungeons and there to be engaged in deeper conversations,
with old, wise, very experienced interrogators, and a slow,
lingering, very painful death, if he was lucky. Rather than a quick
knife thrust from my blade and the easy death I would grant him, as
payment for his information."</p>
<p class="western">"Slipping from the rear of the wagon wrapped
tightly in my cloak, though I would not need its protection, other
than against the cold of the night, I darted into the woods.
Carefully I selected a place behind and partially beneath a fallen
tree trunk. It offered some protection against the wind and rain
should it decide to pelt down, it also offered the much more
valuable protection of shielding my body from the camp, whilst
allowing me to retain a limited view."</p>
<p class="western">"I watched as the driver walked into sight,
talking out loud, stopping and starting, interrupting his speech as
though he was listening to a reply, before continuing his
conversation. The odd thing was that despite the fact that I could
clearly hear the driver, I could not hear any reply! But the change
in the subjects sounded more like banter or disagreement during a
discussion, which was puzzling. As much as I might wish to view the
camp and answer my puzzling questions I held back, invisibility
suited my position best, what did it matter how many creatures
occupied that camp? Tomorrow they would split and head their
separate ways, and I would follow and capture the wagon and its
driver, I had made my decision without even realising it."</p>
<p class="western">"The night passed without any encounters, I
didn't see anyone but the driver and for all I knew he could be a
little mad and talking to himself, and the camp could have been
empty. I decided that the risk of stumbling in to an unseen guard,
out weighed the possibility of the insanity and loneliness of my
prey. I waited."</p>
<p class="western">"As dawn arrived slightly later than I might
normally have expected because of the encapsulation of this area by
mountains and woodland, I sat up listening. The driver was already
packing away his meager night used belongings, and hastily slinging
them into the rear of the wagon, for reasons of his own he made no
attempt to return them to their storage places. I prepared myself
to slip the short distance out of hiding and re-enter the wagon.
That was when disaster befell me again Sire."</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The dwarf to my mind looked slightly
crestfallen at the last statement; it would take something pretty
drastic to deflate a dwarf in full story telling mode, so I nodded
for him to continue, feeling quite intrigued.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"As I stood up to step over the tree behind
which I had spent the night, I felt the cold touch of a quick icy
death rest against my neck. I had heard nothing, sensed less and
had now been taken totally by surprise, who or whatever had
captured me had the stealth of an Elf and the skill of a Dwarf all
mixed together. Infact I decided right then and there, that I would
keep my hands well clear of my weapons, so as not to tempt this
whatever, into feeling threatened, because I was certain that if it
did I would most likely end up with my blood spilled across the
floor."</p>
<p class="western">"Now I understood the wagon drivers strange
and deliberately hasty actions, he was a diversion, something for
me to focus on whilst this creature behind me snuck up and captured
or killed me. Damn him, how I wondered, had my presence been
detected at all? What mistake had I made? I was down wind of the
camp, invisible of sight, and concealed totally beneath my cape,
how had they discovered my presence? If I survived the morning and
somehow won the day, then I would make blooming sure that the
driver explained everything. For now though I felt the sharp point
of a long blade encouraging me to step out of hiding and into the
open, I complied having very little option. My capturer was no
fool, he withdrew slightly and by the time I realised he had gone,
he was holding a drawn longbow with its waiting arrow pointed
directly at my spine.</p>
<p class="western">'He,' because that is the only name I have
for the creature with the bow, 'He,' stood taller than me, but
seeing as I am a wide not tall dwarf, 'He,' being taller came as no
surprise. 'He,' wore a long dark coloured cape, bound at the waist
with a weapons belt, in which rested the sword that had so
grievously been placed against my neck. 'He,' carried 'his' self
much like a man, but little of his body could be seen, the fingers
looked human as they gripped the bow, an eye glared along the arrow
looking competently at my belly for as I had stepped forward so he
had moved to obtain a better view of me. His body stood firm,
upright, tightly controlled, very efficient looking, as though he,
the creature had been taught in the military fashion. There was no
tremble to the hands, no hint of possible hesitation, only a
distinct feeling of absolute certainty that if 'He' let the arrow
fly, then that arrow would kill its intended target, which clearly
was me. I understood that quite easily; reading it and more, in my
quick glance back and I decided that a wise dwarf would behave, and
Sire, I consider myself to be a wise dwarf, well most of the
time."</p>
<p class="western">"The driver appeared around the wagon back,
now carrying a large battle axe with a glistening sharp edge to it.
The weapon seemed superfluous to me, what with 'Him' with 'his'
arrow drawn tight behind me. 'He' I noticed had even stepped
further out to my right, thus increasing his options and my
visibility should I attempt for instance, to dart around the wagon
in the hope of using it for cover. 'He,' had the battle experience
enough to divine exactly what I was thinking, and to act
accordingly. Now I was facing two of them, both armed, both deadly
to me, both my enemies that needed killing, much as I think I am to
them. Perhaps I could convince them otherwise? The first desperate
glimmer of a plan began to form in my mind."</p>
<p class="western">"I knew that the wagon was empty and that
this driver was presently returning, what I didn't know was what
goods he had delivered? I could guess from the scrapes and gouges
in the wooden sides that whatever it had been was packed in heavy
boxes, so not corn or bales or probably even food! No none of
those, it was more likely that he was delivering arm's, weapons
with which to kill his own kind, and for one lousy reason only,
that of profit. I have always said, 'never trust the merchant, he
wants his pound of flesh and does not care how he gets it,' this
man proved me right."</p>
<p class="western">"Thinking fast, I glanced at his clothes,
seeking further clues to his business. His hands were calloused but
not weapon use calloused, like mine were. No, his were calluses
caused by lifting and swinging weights. That to my mind placed him
as being of low order in the merchant's scheme of importance. A new
or perhaps failing merchant, one that worked as hard as those he
employed (probably on pitiful wages). So now my thoughts turned to
the 'Him' behind me, clearly well trained, clearly deadly, and
clearly working for this merchant; though why I hadn't a clue. The
man creature behind me poses the most direct threat to my survival,
but only I reasoned, if the merchant orders 'Him' to kill me, or I
threatened 'His' safety directly! So remain quiet dwarf I thought,
use your mouth as a double edged weapon and carve these two to the
bone, before finally and fatally striking at them.</p>
<p class="western">"I'm glad I caught up with you, I wasn't sure
that it was the right wagon!" I said sounding as confident and
relaxed as I could under the circumstances. 'He,' looked at me; I
was watching him out of the corner of my eye hoping to make an
effect, to confuse him slightly.</p>
<p class="western">"I think you will find that it was me that
caught you, dear friend!" the watching warrior stated.</p>
<p class="western">'He' didn't like having his perceptions
challenged."</p>
<p class="western">"You caught me!" I countered. "Why, I will
have you know, that I have been chasing after you since the day
after you left camp, Spiderman wanted me to catch up to you, he
wants more, he said to tell you."</p>
<p class="western">"The Merchant driver infront of me was
concentrating more on my words than on my actions, his blade had
dropped slightly, he was vulnerable but I was not stupid enough to
attack him, not then anyway. The 'He,' was after all watching my
every move and 'He,' I noticed hadn't relaxed 'His' grip on the
tight drawn bow string, with its sharp pointed arrow notched, ready
to kill me. No 'He' distrusted me still, I need to create a more
plausible reason for my presence."</p>
<p class="western">"I will admit though that your man caught me
well and proper by surprise, I didn't think anyone would notice my
presence, but blow me, He." I carefully waved my hand towards the
'He' character, before continuing, noticing that the merchants eyes
followed my hand. "Caught me He did, an without me hearing a thing,
and me being a dwarf as well. Arr well, a penny to profit, bodes a
dwarf well for his old age." I waited holding my breath would he
take the bait, had I planted a seed of doubt in the merchants mind,
had I?"</p>
<p class="western">"Who are you?" Demanded the wagon master.</p>
<p class="western">He sounded interested though mixed with
suspicious.</p>
<p class="western">"Me I am a lowly supplier of interesting
items to interested parties, not one of note, or anywhere up to
your exalted level of trade, but I do all right, mostly." I added
as a finishing touch. If they looked too deep they might wonder why
a lowly trader carried so efficient a looking set of battle arms,
but I could explain them if I had to.</p>
<p class="western">"How did you follow us, I neither heard nor
saw any wagon, or even a horse?"</p>
<p class="western">I laughed, this was the tricky part,
explaining my arrival, 'keep it simple' I reminded myself. 'The
best lies are nearly true and very simple, so as not to trip up the
teller'.</p>
<p class="western">"I Sir am a Dwarf!" I injected the obvious
into the statement. "As a dwarf and I am sure that you know this."
I winked at him. "We dwarves don't really get on too well with
beasts of burden, they don't seem to like to carry us far, and it
always hurts when they dump us on the ground. Well in the pride
really, I mean that's where it hurts, so we dwarves run. We run for
miles and miles daily. We run, not as fast as the wind or the
Elves, but far more evenly, we pace and pace not too fast, not too
slow. On the flat or up the hills, sometimes we even run down them,
but that can be nearly as embarrassing to the dwarf who tries it as
being unseated from a beast; as tumbling forward is often the
outcome for us dwarves if we run down steep hills."</p>
<p class="western">"I was rambling on, saying nothing really to
them, but drawing them in very slowly. Even 'He' seemed to be
listening now, but still that arrow pointed at me. I rambled on a
bit more, saying even less, until the merchant interrupted my flow
impatiently."</p>
<p class="western">"You claim some ability as a merchant then?"
He looked at me puzzled trying to make sense of what his eyes told
him, compared to what his ears heard. I looked like a soldier, but
now his ears said, I speak like a merchant, the two were
diametrically opposed, but a merchant that could soldier, in the
middle of a war such a merchant could do well out of the situation,
and might prove useful to a merchant that could not think like a
warrior. Equally such a merchant could pose a considerable threat
to successful trade, or even the odds of survival."</p>
<p class="western">"A vender of trinkets would be more like it
Sir, not a fine merchant like your fine self." I hoped that I was
getting to him, it seemed to me that I was, but only time would
tell. He still might order my covered friend, now conveniently
placed in my blind spot to my right, to kill me, and I am
absolutely certain that there would be no hesitation in him
releasing that arrow into my body."</p>
<p class="western">The merchant seemed to suddenly accept that I
was who I said I was, a messenger sent to demand more goods of him,
he relaxed slightly, hoping to make a compatriot of me in trade and
to make use of any military knowledge that I have, or so I began to
believe. As in half a hope I watched as he lowered his weapon and
invited me to sit with him around the still burning fire. We sat,
him and I, we, talked of the trading of goods, of the coming war
and the profits to be made. We talked of wagons rolling across the
plain out yonder, filled with weapons of war; we talked of axes and
pikes, of swords and daggers, and all without me realising that he
was probing my story."</p>
<p class="western">"He was a good trader, and like a good trader
he sized me up and cut my thoughts out of my head with his sharp
tongue and keener wits. I talked, appearing to relax, hoping for an
opportunity. His companion did not join in and whether by chance or
intent 'He' rarely, if ever entered my peripheral vision. 'He'
hovered at a distance feigning disinterest, but as I was to find
out, keeping his total attention focused on us as we communed. 'He'
understood the situation, 'He' understood the merchant, and unlike
me, He recognised the secret instruction to murder me!"</p>
<p class="western">"I heard only the twang of a bow string as an
arrow flew across the encampment, followed almost instantly by
another and another. The second arrow thudded into the wood of a
dead tree on which I was sitting facing towards the fire. I threw
myself forwards, catching the merchant around the throat, already
noting the wood shaft buried to the flight, sticking out from his
chest. The merchant was dead, killed instantly by one arrow."</p>
<p class="western">"My dagger flew into my hand as from the
bushes two creatures burst out charging across the camp, heading
for me, with fixed attention and swords drawn. I rolled, missing
the flames, finding my feet as the first ploughed into me, my
dagger plunged to the hilt, warm blood trickled across my fingers
to drop to the floor and be absorbed by the dust."</p>
<p class="western">"The second creature was nearly upon me, when
a grey wolf lunged from cover and took the creature to the ground
by its throat, one quick shake and my assailant was dead. The wolf
released its prey, turning to face the camp and me, whilst looking
for another victim. I brought my dagger up over my shoulder
intending to throw it at the wolf and then charge the creature
taking my chances with its teeth and claws, hopefully wrestling it
to the ground and choking it to death."</p>
<p class="western">"My hand stung as the dagger flew from my
fingers. The arrow that had hit the dagger shattered and fell in
half at my feet. The wolf ignored me prowling the camp, hunting for
anyone that threatened it, there was no one left alive, between us
all we had killed each and every assailant. From the bushes to my
left an elf walked into the camp, he held a bow still drawn to
half-way; he looked at the bodies then approached my covered
assailant."</p>
<p class="western">"He' lay dead with an elf shaft protruding
from his throat, his head thrown back and pinned to the ground by
that arrow. I joined the elf looking at the obvious corpse,
reaching down I pulled at the material that still somehow covered
his face. With a rip the black cloth came away from the flesh
beneath. Long red tinted hair cascaded to the floor, resting in the
blood pooled and fast drying beneath the body. That hair looked too
fine, too well coiffured to be anything but what it was. We (I and
the elf) looked at the mortal remains of a woman, dead at our
hands, her life deservedly extinguished. We both knew that she
would have looked down on our bodies were the situation reversed
and with the same lack of guilt."</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The elf and dwarf looked at one another and
both felt the bond of death forming a united brotherhood; the wolf
paced the camp, circling the wagon ignoring his companion and the
dwarf, hunting for something to kill. There was nothing and
eventually the wolf accepted the situation, it walked cat like to
the fire and flopped down, turning its shaggy head towards its
companions, old and new alike, watching as they inspected the dead
creature.</p>
<p class="western">There was little if anything to learn from
the body, the weapons that had been visible to the dwarf whilst
held captive, proved to be but a small part of the armoury that she
carried. If she was as proficient with each item as she had
appeared to be with the bow and coupled with her expertise and
skill as a guard, then she would have been a formidable opponent,
or if things had been different, a deadly friend. In a way the
dwarf was saddened at her death, it had been so pointless on one
hand, and yet so necessary on the other.</p>
<p class="western">As for the carcass of the trader, that he
would leave for the carrion eaters to dispose off. He was a traitor
to all that is civilized, she was an employee, whether she agreed
with his aims or not, would never be properly known, but the dwarf
preferred to believe that she did not, and would have departed from
his service at the first opportunity. Her body he decided should be
buried. Iffilditch looked slightly puzzled at the dwarf's
suggestion, but allowed him to do so anyway.</p>
<p class="western">The body weighed very little to the muscular
dwarf as he laid it in a shallow grave, he did not even have a name
to carve on a marker, but in his mind he would always remember her
as a brave and skilled opponent. With the body disposed of
formally, the dwarf returned to the fire side, eyeing the wolf that
lay there. He sat back on the log he had previously occupied,
whilst Iffilditch preferred to sit next to the wolf and to rub at
its head, showing the dwarf the bond that existed between the
pair.</p>
<p class="western">"So you escaped!" Iffilditch broke the
silence.</p>
<p class="western">"Yes." Replied the dwarf automatically, then
looking across at the elf he added. "How did you know that I was a
captive in the first place?"</p>
<p class="western">"It was I that shot the arrow that distracted
your captors; it was this wolf that led me to the place from which
I shot that arrow. And it was both of us that realised that you
were in need of a distraction to aid in your escape."</p>
<p class="western">"Well for your assistance I thank you, but I
had my escape well under my own control!"</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Sire, I found that I was staring at the elf
and bristling for no apparent reason, why I could not understand
did this elf make me feel so bloody incompetent. True the elf had
saved me from the she's arrow that morning, and apparently, he had
also fired the arrow that had distracted the camp yesterday, but
still why did I feel so put down inside. It was plain stupid,
clearly this elf was a friend, infact for some reason I felt that I
should recognize this elf, but I could not place him. Sire, I
studied the wolf hoping for a revelation but none came my way,
finally I reached out my hand to the elf saying. 'I am Drilldringle
of the mountains of Loganor, son of Drilldringle of the Mountains
of Loganor, and I accept your assistance gratefully and offer my
friendship to you. The elf looked at me and with an annoying smile,
he offered me his hand and we then linked hands, though he did not
respond to my obvious interest as to who he was?</p>
<p class="western">"Dear dwarf, I and my wolf accept your
friendship with thanks. Perhaps something to eat might be in order
though?" Damn him I laughed, traditionally it is us dwarves that
are always hungry, but then I had not met a wolf before, at least
not one that I was going to feed, and Sire, blow me they can really
eat!"</p>
<p class="western">"The merchant had not skimped on food; locked
within the side carry boxes of the wagon we found the most splendid
array of food stuffs ever to grace a field kitchen. I as the
woodsman elected myself to be cook, and so it was that a short
while later the elf and I were tucking into bird soup filled with
potatoes and meat, whilst the wolf gnawed away at a roast leg of
some unfortunate creature. Soon the food vanished and we feeling
more lugubrious conversation began to flow. That Sire was when your
elf introduced himself for the first time."</p>
<p class="western">"We discussed the devastating news that such
an army awaited battle with us, then we faced the immediate future,
were we to either take the wagon and trust to its camouflage, its
acceptance by the guardians of Nailstead's peace of mind, or do we
leave it and travel on foot, relying instead on our skills to keep
us hidden and therefore safe. I was more in favour of taking the
wagon; it seemed such a waste to leave it behind for the enemy to
use. Destroying it was not an option, the smoke of a burning wagon
would attract all and sundry to this place if we fired it, so the
choices open to us were simple. Take it, or leave it?"</p>
<p class="western">"The decision seemed right at the time, take
the wagon and drive on through the valleys until we reach a
suitable place from which to cross the expanse separating us from
home. All seems obvious, so that is exactly what we decided to do,
the only concern I had as I looked at the elf was that he would
always look exactly like an elf. I as a dwarf could be taken for a
stumpy old male human from a distance; he though could never be
mistaken. His tall willowy body topped by thick blond hair and
pointy ears were all giveaways to his heritage."</p>
<p class="western">"Then there was one other to consider. The
wolf, it was a creature of the wild and as such it would not most
likely be traveling with a wagon! Had this wagon passed this way on
its inward trip then it would have been seen by possibly quite a
few of Nailstead's scouts. Would they have noticed an elf and a
wild wolf, traveling alongside of a human or dwarf, I think so, and
I also said so!"</p>
<p class="western">"The solution it seemed to the wolf's
presence divined itself; the wolf sniffed once at the wagon and
then ignored it completely. Preferring instead to lope alongside or
around us, as we slowly plodded across the plain, heading into the
last range of mountains between us and home. Iffilditch sat next to
me, a piece of cloth wrapped around his head, his shoulders hunched
down trying to look like anything other than what he was. The day
passed uneventfully and later as night fell again we camped,
trusting the wolf to sound us a warning should any unwanted
attention be paid to our presence, it wasn't and early the next day
we resumed our escape."</p>
<p class="western">"Two more days passed as had the first Sire,
uneventfully. It was on the fourth day that things began to change.
We had driven around a valley twist and could now see out beyond
the opening. The plain spread out before us should have been the
last but one barrier to our successful escape, but it was not. The
plain was nothing more than one giant landscape of canvas. Tents
spread out for as far as I could see from my wagons seat. Mile upon
mile of tightly compacted tents, filled with hundreds of thousands
of Nailstead's minions, and all preparing for the coming war, I
expected!"</p>
<p class="western">"Had I not known of the other encampment
behind us I would have thought that we had stumbled onto
Nailstead's prime army, instead I realised that the force before us
was only one part of his army! I began to wonder if there were
other encampments dotted, hidden, amongst the surrounding valleys.
Exactly how many troops faced our peoples? How powerful is the army
of Nailstead? I know Sire that you would ask me these questions and
a guess would not suffice as an answer. It also became instantly
obvious to me that Iffilditch could go no further, he would have to
take his wolf and depart quickly, I though would have to trust to
his skill as a woodsman to see him safely home. One of us should
with luck return with the news, in time for you Sire to mount a
defense, though how that might be possible at that point I had
little idea!"</p>
<p class="western">"Iffilditch slipped from the moving wagon
Sire, I dared not stop the vehicle, guards on the perimeters of the
force would certainly have noted the slow plodding approach of my
wagon, they would be unconcerned so far, as it approaches from deep
inside of their own territory, but were I to stop, then that
concern might bloom. So it was that Iffilditch with the briefest of
farewells had slipped over the side and vanished in the dust of my
wagons wheels."</p>
<p class="western">"The wolf followed him and together they
crept away from us. I could only hope that they had made a stealth
filled and invisible escape, as I slowly crept forward towards the
encampment; another camp through which I had to pass undetected if
I was to obtain my freedom on the far side and return to you
Sire."</p>
