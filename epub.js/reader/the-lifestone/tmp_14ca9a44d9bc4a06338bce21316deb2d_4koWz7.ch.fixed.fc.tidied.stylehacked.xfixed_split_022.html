<p class="western">Nailstead looked down across the plain at his
remaining troops, all gathered together ready for the final attack.
Out there beyond the plain, through the last rock barrier,
thousands more of his minions gathered, spreading out from the
black road, gathering together, keeping his enemies troops
occupied. He had no interest in them; they were expendable, only
serving a purpose by their presence. Below him he watched as a
single gangling figure mounted a horse and spurred it into motion.
Spider man as the dwarf had called him departed riding hard.</p>
<p class="western">His plan was nearly complete; all of the
pieces of this game were nearly positioned. Out there he could feel
the trolls hammering against the witch's fortifications. He
extended his mental reach, zeroing in on the throb of eagerness
which surrounded four of his rock trolls. Four creatures, each with
just one job to do, four powerful, unstoppable, creatures, sent out
with only one thought filling their tiny minds, four to kill one
witch.</p>
<p class="western">He looked out across his minions whilst
reaching back into his memory, congratulating himself on his
understanding of the dark arts. He could feel the witch in her
distant rock home, but even with the power of the stone, if she
could use it, which he doubted, he was not fearful. He had dealt
her a crushing blow; something that no other sorcerer had been able
to utilise. He had sought out the rock trolls, reached into them,
unified them; he had brought the solitary creatures together. It
had taken him months to perfect his latest ability, but he
Nailstead had, finally. He had gathered to him the most powerful of
allies available anywhere and sent them to act on his instructions.
The creature's natural preference for isolation had been crushed by
his magic then remolded and replaced with group loyalty only to
him.</p>
<p class="western">His head tilted back as he vented his anger
out into the world, a scream from the dark magic sent out to
shatter the world, to announce his presence, desire and intent to
all. A challenge vented to a King waiting to be destroyed but not
believing that it was happening.</p>
<p class="western">"Only I, Nailstead, the true ruler, only I
have the power over life, only I have taken the magic's of ancient
times and mixed them. Only I have succeeded." He looked down again,
swimming in the anger being unleashed far away by them, his four
rock trolls. He smiled, no one could see his smile but a ripple of
pleasure rolled through the gathered armies below, they, all of
them sensed his pleasure; some even turned snouted heads upwards
towards their lord, as he basked in his delight and thoughts of the
future.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Anger mounted at the delay, they wanted
blood, they wanted human and elf and dwarf blood to cover over and
taint the plains. They wanted destruction and fear and death to
rein across this world. They wanted to serve their masters desire
with the total eradication of the usurper and his followers. Only
then could peace once more exist, though not a single creature
below understood the true meaning of peace, of family, of
friendship, they could only understand the black heart of
destruction, of mayhem, of death.</p>
<p class="western">They were the banished creatures, separated
from the souls of man and beast thousands of years ago. They were
the dark thoughts, the evil deeds, the unnecessary nastiness of
those they opposed. Gathered together and moulded into life by the
dark magic long before the dawn of true enlightenment had arrived.
They had a history that ran parallel but forgotten by their
counterparts out on the far side of the plain, they were the
banished.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">From beyond, Nailstead felt his link fade as
the rock trolls returned to their more natural occupation. They
were asleep, shut down, their target must be destroyed or they
would still be battling, he understood that they would never stop,
were impervious to almost all magic, it just bounced of off them.
They did not have the mental ability to understand the force used
against them, so they were immune to attack by normal or magical
essences, they are Rock Troll's, solid set and unmovable in their
aim, his aim Nailstead thought, 'my aim,' he mouthed silently to
himself.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead reached out beyond them feeling the
air, noting with pleasure that the witches presence was gone! His
plan had worked; he had killed the witch, now he must continue on
and destroy his main target. Soon he would have power once more,
the power over life and death; soon, he Nailstead would be at
peace, soon it would be he that ruled not the usurper.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Taking a final glance back and up as he
placed his foot into the stirrup revealed his master, standing
proud on the rock promontory. Swinging into the saddle, feeling his
gangling legs firmly astride the powerful horse, Spider man kicked
hard. The horse reacted by charging forward; creature's shuffled
and slithered out of his way. Feet pounded the earth clearing a
path as he raced away from the gathering, thundering at a gallop
towards his destiny. A destiny his master had created, and also
provided him with the means to succeed with. It banged against his
spine resting in its sheath; it was a dagger a black twisted wavy
bladed dagger. The master had withdrawn the weapon to show him its
blade before entrusting it to him.</p>
<p class="western">This was not a cutting weapon, it would never
slash open flesh, it had but one use, to thrust into flesh, its
black pointed pin sharp blade would pierce through the finest of
chain-mail effortlessly, it would drive easily through the flesh
beneath such mail, but its death dealing ability was not totally
reliant on a thrust. The blade was a dark black, but within the
bleakness of its metal lived another power to kill. The blade was
imbued with dark magic, it, the master had said had a power of its
own. Any creature that was so much as touched by the blade would
eventually die, even him! The master had stressed that he must not
ever touch the blade, he was only to hold its lumpy, pommel shaped
grip. He need only touch his targets flesh and its death was
assured; a slow painful death, one filled with nightmares and evil,
a death of the old age, a death driven by dark ancient curses, a
death assured.</p>
<p class="western">The blade rested against his spine almost
comfortably as he rode through Nailstead's armies, riding hard for
the dark road and immortality. Before him his track cleared, just
as the master had said it would; soon his horse would be racing on
the hard dark pathway, then he would join with his escort, and
soon, very soon his mission would be fulfilled and the battle won
for his master. Whether he survived did not matter to him, his mind
was filled only with the demands placed their by Nailstead. Kill
the target, stab it to death, become the hero of the night, receive
and be honored by your fellows.</p>
<p class="western">Deep inside of the spider man glowed a little
light burning bright, a light of doubt, but Nailstead had sensed
and covered that tiny glow, he would have chosen another for this
mission. To Nailstead's annoyance the dark magic had demanded that
the final arbitrator of the coming battle be one of his enemy, a
human, and this spider man was the one chosen, the one best suited
to the task. Nailstead had bewitched him, turning him from the
light, warping his mind until he served only the dark and him.</p>
<p class="western">The spider man was not one of Nailstead's
minions, he was a changeling creature, one trapped by dark forces,
manipulated by evil, and sent to carry death to a mortal enemy. He
was helpless to resist, tightly controlled, infected with the blood
lust of his master and doomed to obey the will of the dark lord. He
was as much of a victim as the target he intended to kill, a target
that awaited his death out there, across the plain, at the far end
of the black road by the stunted tree.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead intended to reach out with his
thoughts eager to prepare the ground for his agent to utilise;
instead he felt a push against his spirit. From yonder he felt the
growth of a power unlike any that he had ever encountered. The
witch! He immediately thought, the witch lives, but no he
cautioned. This did not have the feel of a woman, nor did it have
the control of her over the magic it was exuding. He turned his
attention towards the far mountains expecting to locate the source
immediately.</p>
<p class="western">Another he thought, sensing a male presence,
a new and dangerous challenger. He will not survive. Nailstead
reached deeper into his mind forming words in a long dead language,
preparing for the fight to come, preparing to destroy the
interloper on his success. Behind him something strange began to
happen to the land. Something unheard of. A power was being
unleashed within the stones of the mountains, a power about and
over which Nailstead knew nothing and had even less control.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Vindec had returned to the stone room, he
stood, as the witch had stood, before the elfin stone, reaching
into it with his thoughts. The stone was different, changed
somehow, he puzzled seeking answers to his confusion not from the
stone, but from the store of knowledge that the witch had gifted to
him. One thought exploded in his confused mind that was the stone,
the elfin stone was now alive! It was no longer a tool to be used
by a knowledgeable elder; it was an entity with life of its
own!</p>
<p class="western">The witch has joined with the stone he
realised, looking deeper. She resides as a part of the magic
contained now within the glowing stone. He stepped back; the stone
was glowing brighter than ever before. It hadn't been glowing more
than a single candle the last time he had looked towards it. It
hadn't glowed when he had returned from dealing with the rock
trolls, but now it lit up the cavern, casting a pleasant, quite
relaxing yellow light around and over everything. He even had a
shadow extending out from his feet, created by the glow or light or
power or whatever it was that was emanating from the heart of the
stone.</p>
<p class="western">He settled on thinking that the light was the
stone, and the stone was the life. Instead of being a stone of
power an inanimate object, he was now pondering upon the existence
of life. Before him was the only Lifestone ever to have existed!
The witch's voice filled in the missing gaps, explained in his
thoughts that it was she, and she was it, and he was the one to use
both her and the stone for the ultimate benefit of all decent
minded creatures. Vindec understood, sensed the power granted to
him by the Lifestone and accepted the responsibility that such
power demands. He reached in deeper accepting his role of keeper of
the stone, wielder of its force, protector of all that was good and
right. He had become the enemy of the dark night and black power.
He had become the Enemy of the dark lord Nailstead, who was even
now probing at his thoughts trying to seek out any weaknesses that
remained in him.</p>
<p class="western">A force of evil spilled across the world,
Vindec could see it as a dark cloud floating in a blue sky, he
could sense it attacking and eating into the thoughts of man elf
and dwarf. He understood that the cloud needed, wanted to expand,
that it would swamp and destroy if left unchallenged. That it would
seek out power and use it for destruction, death and mayhem fed the
cloud, death and mayhem were its only reason to exist. He could
feel foggy tendrils reaching out towards him, trying to interweave
around the cavern, intending he sensed, to enter and swamp his
desire for peace and harmony. That was what was wrong; the harmony
of life was being distorted, twisted usurped.</p>
<p class="western">He took a breath, his first since reentering
into the cavern, not having realised that he had not inhaled for
over four minutes during the Lifestone's revelations. 'The witch is
gone, it now all falls on me,' he thought, pushing back hard
against the fog which was quickly building around his new home. The
tendrils were clearly visible to his mind, as they swirled and
linked together he watched them reaching out, he pushed against
them with his thoughts to little effect, they swirled around his
outreach, almost slick with water, much like an eel sliming around
a rock. He broadened the front of his attack still with no
success.</p>
<p class="western">Then from outside of his thoughts the voice
that linked him to the Lifestone entered his mind, it made a simple
suggestion.</p>
<p class="western">"Fog can be contained then eradicated, but
not easily pushed away; it floats willingly aside at any contact
but always returns and reforms."</p>
<p class="western">Vindec opened up his mind, feeling a raw
power build, he strained then felt his outreach flatten and begin
to swirl, its shape changed as did the texture in his mind. First
it formed into a ring, then a bag, then he inhaled deeply feeling
the bag match him, the fog tendrils floated inwards, deeper, all
the time filling his mental magic created bag. Some tendrils
snapped and pulled back from the bag, withdrawn by the sender as
his realisation of failure pierced through both his desires and
pride. Vindec knew that he had defeated the dark lord in their
first joust but that there would be many more to come, and he had
to win all of them if humanity as he knew it was to survive the
presence of Nailstead the dark lord and master of the dark
night.</p>
<p class="western">The bag faded to nothing, inside of it the
fog merged to nothing, its power to create harm neutralised by its
disconnection from its creator and master. Out there Vindec sensed
seething anger fast brewing. Out there he sensed the burgeoning
scent of the fear of failure. He sensed the growth of doubt
beginning to replace Nailstead's long held confidence in his own
abilities. Out there he discovered that Nailstead was desperately
fighting for control over his fear and anger, whilst reaching into
his warped mind, intent on fighting back.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec did not know what he was going to do,
how he was going to use the Lifestone, he only understood that he
was the last and only magical defense between the people and
Nailstead. Yes, the battle with swords and bows would rage on, but
the King would deal with that as best that he could. It was he,
Vindec, that would fight the dark forces, and he intended to win no
matter the cost.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Dwarf was nearly around the periphery of the
King's army, the horse he was racing had reached the end of its
stamina, it was flagging fast, wind blown and lathered. He spied a
suitable replacement and twisting and slowing the puffing animal,
he rode it up to a rope enclosure, dismounting fast, not even
securing the beast that had carried him this far. He grabbed at the
reins of a replacement only to feel the heavy hand of a grisly dirt
encrusted soldier holding him back.</p>
<p class="western">"What the hell do you think you are doing
dwarf?" He demanded to know.</p>
<p class="western">Startled by his presence, the dwarf half
turned in desperation.</p>
<p class="western">"I ride on the King's business, now get out
of my way!"</p>
<p class="western">"Well so you say," he turned away from the
dwarf looking towards the soldiers grouped around waiting to move
up and engage the enemy, looking for one, spying him he shouted
out, calling him over.</p>
<p class="western">"Captain!"</p>
<p class="western">Across from the frantic dwarf a familiar face
turned towards him. The dwarf raised a hand and pointed at the
horse, the captain shook his head indicating no, the dwarf felt his
frustration level rise, but the captain knew best as he was soon
was to discover. Signaling to another the captain waved towards a
horse and pointed towards the dwarf, the soldier looked puzzled but
obeyed, he swiftly brought up a saddled pure white mare. The dwarf
recognised the beast it was the captain's racer, his own mount.
Something strange was happening the dwarf realised, as the soldier
held out the reins to him. Never one to ignore fate the dwarf took
the reins and mounted. A voice called out to him from across the
roadway, it was the captain, he shouted out.</p>
<p class="western">"Ride dwarf, save the King, save us all!"</p>
<p class="western">Then with a gentle kick of his heels the
dwarf raced away, hoping that he could fulfill the captain's
instruction, but at the sametime wondering why that little incident
had occurred. How he puzzled, as he raced away, rounding a wagon
team being unloaded, how could the captain have known what he was
about? How could anyone know what he was about? He had only
recently deciphered the evidence he had witnessed and realised the
threat it implied, so again he asked himself; how could the captain
know anything?</p>
<p class="western">His mind drifted, trying desperately to make
sense of the situation, but failing. His attention was sharply
brought back to controlling the horse when without warning the
creature leapt up and over a dip in the road, a dip filled with
brackish slow running water, the jump nearly threw him out of the
saddle.</p>
<p class="western">In the distance he could now see the brick
and rubble walls, the place where he had last seen the King as he
had prepared for the up coming battle. He spurred the horse on,
willing everything to be all right, desperate to arrive and
hopefully avoid the coming destiny; a destiny that he sensed was
fast approaching. He looked out across the battle ground seeing the
gathering of creatures, held back for the time being by hundreds of
soldiers all facing towards them.</p>
<p class="western">Why he wondered had they not attacked what
were they waiting for? The answer arrived to his questions, his
doubts in his instincts shattered as the ground out there to either
side of the black road heaved.</p>
<p class="western">Behind the lifting earth the gathering of
Nailstead's army parted, revealing a lone rider, racing like he was
towards the front line. Unlike dwarf, the other rider pulled his
horse up, halting it beside the heaving ground. The dwarf rode on
feeling more desperate, more intent; whilst also watching the
strange goings on out beside the black road. For one second his
vision blurred as a memory forced its way up and out of his
subconscious. He recognised the man astride the horse; he
recognised the long gangly legs, the overly long arms and the
flowing hair now revealed as the man dismounted.</p>
<p class="western">The King, he could see the King! Not far now,
he gauged the distance between him and his King, comparing it to
the distance between the spider man and his King, spider man was
closer than he was, but spider man for some reason was now standing
on the road looking forward, unsure but seeking out the King, the
dwarf realised.</p>
<p class="western">Either side of the road and spider man, the
earth was lifted, thrown up and away as twin powerful arms revealed
a missing pair of rock trolls. The dwarf had been right, the trolls
were an ambush for the King, but he had expected to see six of the
dangerous enemy, not just the two that were now revealed. He
careered the horse towards the King, he could see him seated at the
tree, sitting upright with Iffilditch beside him. The elf looked
concerned, he was pulling at the King's armour, removing a portion
of it and casting it aside.</p>
<p class="western">"No!" screamed the dwarf, desperate to
attract the elves attention. A gust of wind, evil scented and
determined snatched his scream away, muffling it. The dwarf now
crouched forward, his arms gripping tight around the horse's neck,
trying to encourage yet more speed from the animal, whilst
helplessly watching as the King's breast plate was cast aside and
fell to the floor, raising little puffs of dust into the air,
leaving him vulnerable!</p>
<p class="western">Out there, the rock trolls rose up, having
freed themselves they stood as silent powerful guards to the spider
man; who was pulling a weapon out of a sheath fitted tight to his
back. The light glinted off the black evil blade as the spider man
stepped forward once more, his pace accelerating accompanied by the
marching thud of the rock trolls, all seen clearly by the dwarf
heading towards the King. Their intent was obvious, the spider man
would be the one to deliver the fatal blow, the guardians were not
charged with killing the King only protecting the assassin
chosen.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The spider man had seen his target, he had
known by Nailstead's black arts where to locate the King and he had
arrived, and he could now feel the reassurance of the deadly blade
held tight in his clenched fist eager to be plunged into royal
flesh.</p>
