<p class="western">Whilst the King spoke to the nearest of his
men, on either outer edge of his defensive box, troops closed in as
Nailstead's army a force depleted departed before them, leaving the
field of battle for another destiny. Slowly the area cleared and as
the last creature slithered out of sight, the ground once more
stood barren and empty, bar the littering of shattered corpses and
the blood stained patterns woven across the heavily churned up
grass.</p>
<p class="western">Many creatures had frozen where they stood,
having perished in the witches storm of ice, wasted lives lost,
just to please their dark lord! Leaving behind a scattering of
flesh made figures, puppets without strings, which would finally
collapse to the ground and be gathered eventually for the fire
pits, all bodies would be burnt to cinder to defend against
infection spread.</p>
<p class="western">Already an army of flying scavengers were
appearing, black dots swelled from within dark flitting clouds,
then they settled out of sight, coating the corpses, increasing the
decay by their hunger. Silence fell across the battlefield, the
silence of the dead, the silence of a defeat.</p>
<p class="western">Near to the King a crowd stood listening,
eager to show their support of him that had led them to this point.
Soldiers felt the elation of being alive, of having survived the
confrontation unscathed. Others amongst them felt fear which surged
up, set free now from within their thoughts. Battle fatigue flowed,
though for most present there had been no battle. Still the
feelings exploded and the King stood infront of them watching,
slowly being surrounded by a mass of men, which swelled in steady
ranks as more realised the truth of the situation. Life was
destined to return to normal, they could go back to their homes and
hearths, hug their families, pick up their children and be proud
that they had faced both their fear, and the enemy with honour.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Whilst all this was going on Vindec faced the
crisis that developed in his cavern, not the witches cavern home he
told himself, growing in stature, his cavern home, and it was
invaded. A single entity stood before him, it glanced around,
seeking something other than him. To his left the stone rested
pulsing blue silver light into the room, aware of the dark lord's
arrival; preparing for the upcoming battle.</p>
<p class="western">Inside of the stone the linked mind of the
witch reached out towards the statue still form of Vindec, only to
be rebuffed by him. Her aid was not needed! Only Vindec would face
the dark lord, only Vindec could defeat him. The stone should do
its job, it should create and fulfill the prophesies, but it would
be only Vindec, no longer the water carrier boy that must defend
and defeat this dark entity. The enemy of all that was right, stood
before him, waiting, accessing, looking on in confusion, he had not
expected Vindec, he had come to destroy the witch.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Nailstead was no longer the human boy that
Vindec knew he had been once. He was no longer human in the true
sense of the word. The dark forces had clasped him to their bosom,
molding the helpless boy's nature to fulfill its own desires. They
had creating from the boy king a creature of pure evil, a monster;
they had formed and guided the dark one. He that was destined to
rule and destroy, a creature that represented all of the dark magic
that had ever been driven from the light of the world, and he is
filled with the desire to provide a place for their return.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead does not know that nothing of the
person he had once been remained, or that his mind, will and body
have been totally suborned to the will of the darkness he now
served. He believed that he was still the rightful King! That he
would and should indeed rule, that his status as lord would be
returned to him and thus he believed that he was destined rule,
just as he wanted to. What he does not know is that the power that
controls him, is indeed ancient, it is a force of witch magic, long
ago turned from the path of light and led by confusion. Once drawn
in he was led further by his greed and hatred, along another darker
less visible path, one that desired not a ruler of people, but the
destruction of any that oppose it.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead knew nothing of the long ancient
prophesy, or of the book of power which guided the ancient darkness
to seek a return to its former glory. Nothing is told of the
battles, the deaths, the long black night of a thousand years.
Nothing at all is told to the dark lord, only the stone knows the
truth and now the witch, but neither will speak of it less it
become a reality.</p>
<p class="western">The opponents of what both considered to be
the last battle faced each other, in a room of ancient power lit by
a stone far older than even the thoughts of man, Elf, Dwarf, and
dark lord all combined. A power nearly as old as the planet on
which they stand. A stone formed in the fires before land, a stone
discovered by the elves of old, in the closing time of darkness,
but a stone that precedes all of the magic that had formed, good or
evil. The stone waits, prepared to do what it must to protect not
the people of this world, but the planet of its birth.</p>
<p class="western">The voice that cut through the air carrying
with it all the acquired venom of a pit of vipers.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Where is she?" It demands of I, Vindec as I
stand my ground before the cowled figure of the dark lord.</p>
<p class="western">"Where is she?" It screamed again, the sound
reverberating of the caverns walls. To my left the stone glowed
brightening the room, casting out the dark one's shadow. His
attention flickered from me to the stone. He begins to understand I
divine. I prepare, knowing that soon it will begin; this creature
of the other world will launch its final act of treachery, and
without any warning. In the vain hope that it can eradicate my
resistance to it in one single stroke, it began to speak.</p>
<p class="western">"Where is..." The lightning struck, flaring
across the room, aimed as I had expected at my heart. I moved
slightly, twisting my body, turning sideways, extending my hand,
flicking out a finger. Force met force, struggled together for a
second or two then died back to their respective hosts. The dark
one looked shocked; his cowl had tilted slightly back with the
returning jolt of his emanation. He realised, now he knew the truth
of my power, of the threat to him I posed</p>
<p class="western">"Who are you?"</p>
<p class="western">The question seems pointless to me, what did
it matter to him who I was, only that I stand between him and his
desires and hold a danger and power equal or greater than his
own.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"Leave slug of a man or die horribly!" He
challenges.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">A nice try; I respond not with a lightning
thrusts, but with laughter. The stone pulses, I could feel my heart
beating in my chest, the stone could also feel my life essence, it
matches the dull pounding thud, filling me with a deeper
understanding. Her, the witches voice echoes through my thoughts,
demanding control from me, wanting to face the dark one. I resist
her demand, knowing that if I once allow her to utilise my body she
would take control of it fully, and then it will be her, the witch,
that resides in this male form, not I.</p>
<p class="western">She intends to, desires to, have it all! The
power of the stone by her blending of her mind and also the power
over me taken by stealth. Nailstead, the dark one is mine to
defeat. The stone will aid me but as for the witch within, I am not
sure that I can trust anything she offers to me as assistance. I
have exceeded the knowledge that she has gifted to me, and now I am
standing in this cavern as the epitome of wizardry. Nailstead seems
to still be searching the room, his dull lifeless eyes scanned and
sought, sifting through every crevice. He half turns away from me,
almost ignoring my presence, seemingly with contempt. Then before I
can even see his slight turn back, he is accelerating around,
twisting, spinning his form, his cowl whipping out as gravity tugs
against the material. The battle is commenced, he now knows who his
enemy is, and has engaged in the final battle, the battle for total
control.</p>
<p class="western">His attack fills the air with red streaks of
light, which pulse out a multitude of lightening, some aimed at me,
others passing harmlessly to either side of my body. The he lunges,
a single light ball of blood red glowing power thrust towards me. I
realised my mistake, the harmless seeming tendrils are not
harmless, they restrained my body to one spot, held ready to be
decimated by the real power seeking my destruction, held tight and
compressed within the red ball, which is now hurtling towards me.
Move screams a female voice in my head, I ignore it, instead,
calmly, almost infinitesimally I lift my hands my palms rotate
fingers uppermost.</p>
<p class="western">Blue light swims before me now, a shield of
energy, just as the deeper voice of the stone instructed. All
around me light floods forwards forming into first an oblong, then
swiftly expanding upwards and outwards, creating a barrier to
Nailstead's lunge. They collided, light flickering, flaming and
finally the struggle is lost, it explodes, hurtling energy back
towards the creature that attacked me.</p>
<p class="western">That energy smashes into his cowl, pressing
against it hitting back hard, flattening the cowl against the thin
emaciated body of the dark one hidden beneath it, and outlining him
with his garb. Depicting to me very clearly, the cost that his
chosen union with the ancient forces of the night, and its evil,
have born as a toll upon his once stocky frame. Nailstead resists
his own energies assault, but then my shield extends, forming into
a cage, one with a fast closing once open door.</p>
<p class="western">The creature that had once been the boy King
Nailstead is now battling for his life and sanity, he is
vulnerable, the Lifestone knows it, I know it, and now as the cage
encircles his distracted body, Nailstead knows it; he has been
defeated and so the penalty for his actions awaits him. Glory and
power are gone, snatched from before him and by a mere human. His
anger flaring in his breast succeeded in only channeling more
defeated energy into his fading spirit.</p>
<p class="western">The cage door snapped shut in a glittering
display of electric blue light. Nailstead the Dark Lord is held
captive, the threat he posed has been removed, contained,
subjected; as soon his physical presence will have gone. He like
his true minions will be cast into the never place, to wait and
exist through the passing of time. He will reside in the nothing of
nowhere forever, if the spells needed to bind him can be
created.</p>
<p class="western">I understand the power that is needed, I
understand the duty and sacrifice I and others must voluntarily
make, if we are to ensure that the abyss is protection enough
against the dark one. I know that despite the restraints, he will
attempt, and perhaps succeed in an escape. If allowed he will
become the nemesis of this world once more. It is my duty to ensure
that should this happen, should he escape once more, that the power
exists to defeat him, and return him to his captive state. All this
I instantly understand because the stone of power decreed that I
understand.</p>
<p class="western">The witch voice no longer permeates the
thoughts of the Lifestone, I can sense her presence faintly but it
is only as a part of the whole, not as an entity in its own right.
She no longer exists; she has fulfilled her destiny and created a
living entity within the ancient rock. She will reside with the
Lifestone forever, always in readiness for the dark ones return.
Waiting patiently to assist those in the future that are selected,
tested and become the chosen one by the ancient, yet to be formed
magic. Those destined to resume the on going fight of good verses
evil will be able to utalise its strengths and direct its energies,
but even that may not be enough to contain such as he forever. One
distant day he will return un-challenged to reign, it is prophesied
in the legends of the world and then he will rule, for now though
and far into the future he is contained.</p>
<p class="western">She, the witch is now a watcher and waiter,
whilst others wield the real power. I wonder if she is happy with
her new existence. It seems to me that she did not intend for her
presence to fade into the Lifestone, but she intended to gain the
power of it, and I realise that she also intended to gain the power
over me in her plan. She failed, the dark one failed, but now I
must not fail! I have a lot to do and quickly, but in the passing
of time, quickly is not a word that has any real meaning. The
Lifestone will contain what it has created; it has the power alone
to succeed to do so for generations to come, at least! So, swiftly
is a state of desire with my own mind alone, the abyss awaits, the
Lifestone awaits, all for me to act; it is nearly time for the dark
one to join his minions.</p>
<p class="western">A thought, a concern burst into my mind,
whether it was of my own making or sent out to me by the faintly
glowing Lifestone. I didn't know, but whichever, it needs acting on
immediately.</p>
