<p class="western">Something strange tickled against the outer
fringes of Vindec's mind, he resisted it, not liking the invasion
of his thoughts. The stone glowed before him changing the room;
slightly swamping out the brightness that existed but not
eradicating it, just changing it. Inside, Vindec felt the tickle
grow; it flowed from the stone before which he is stood. It pulled
at his thoughts then pushed them aside as thought they were
nothing. The essence that made him a living entity, his ability to
think faded into the background of his mind. Replaced by the finger
tendrils of the stone, he could feel the witch entering his thought
processes, he could hear her clearly, though there was no sound
present as her voice talked to him, encouraging him to let go, to
stop resisting her.</p>
<p class="western">She broke down his resistance, wore away at
the mental blocks he tried to hang on to, until with an epiphany of
understanding he allowed her to enter into him. Suddenly and
forever his view of the world in which he had grown up changed.
Gone was the peaceful daily life of a young man growing older each
day; his life changed, his body was already changed, now his mind
changed still further. He turned from a boy, a mere water carrier
into a fully fledged magician; he gave up resisting her willingly,
he stepped deeper into the magic offered to him, accepting it as a
gift, not as something to be feared.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec was no longer 'Vindec the water boy,'
he was Vindec the magician in full flow. He saw that what he had
thought was a great ability when he had dealt with the trolls, was
as nothing, mere child's play to the power his union with ancient
knowledge, witch and stone had just presented to him. His mind
soared, escaping the physical restrictions of the cavern, flowing
out across the open world, now he could see the shades of grey
hidden behind the existence, that others less skilled than he
thought to be real! Enlightenment, nirvana, power, all were now his
to control.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead's army passed below his floating
mind; he watched as the ground erupted before the seated King,
seeing as a river of blood red evil the thoughts of Nailstead
pouring out across the gathered troops. He watched until they met
with the ground within which, still partially covered, were hidden
the remaining pair of rock trolls. He watched the fast approach of
the rider, he recognised the black evil strapped to his back and
understood the meaning of that evil.</p>
<p class="western">Dealing with the rider was now far below his
position in life, others could fight the minor infringements that
Nailstead's army represented, he would deal with the black one
himself. His mind extended, casting aside all other concerns whilst
he sought out the power behind the evil.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead stood like a Dark Prince, astride
the high mound, before the hidden entry to the abyss, little,
Vindec sensed, did the dark lord know of the place he had chosen to
launch his attack. Nothing did he know of the ancient blackness
which resided, just waiting to be allowed to open. Behind the anger
driven self appointed ruler of the world, waited the doorway; one
that would soon be opened by Vindec.</p>
<p class="western">He ignored the standing figure, he glanced
down only to sever the mental like between the dark lord and his
minion trolls. Below him a cowled bleak face turned, searching the
skies, sensing Vindec's presence, but unable to engage it.
Nailstead felt the fast closing hand of despair, as it clutched at
his throat, he extended his power only to have it ripped from his
mental grasp, and thrown useless and destroyed to the ground. Fear
filled the dark one for the second time in his life; driving out
his desires, swamping down his vanity, leaving him a shivering,
shattered and confused leader of ... He could not rally his
thoughts, leader of ... he tried to regain control. Leader of...
the... creatures of the night! He reasserted his mind, slowly
turning his attention away from the drawing sky, back to the battle
at hand. He regained some of his confidence, but none of the
control he had been exerting.</p>
<p class="western">His servants would have to act independently
of him, they were understanding enough, he hoped, to act alone if
they chose, but then he realised that rock troll's by their nature
are independent, solitary creatures, in need of guidance to
function together. Out there, erupting from the earth, his
creatures had lost that guidance, what they would do now was beyond
his ability to control.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec ignored the presence of the dark one;
Nailstead would be busy enough for the time being not to pose a
threat to the essence of Vindec. Who now coalesced on the plain at
a carefully chosen point between the rock walls of the valley.
Shimmering into a resemblance of himself, whilst his body stood
immobile in the distant cavern. Vindec looked first to his right
then to his left, he sought out one spot and there infront of him,
not ten short strides away, was the mound he sought. To any
onlooker the mound looked like a barren pimple of rough rock,
protruding once, up out from the ground, but now worn away by the
wind and rain to leave only a disk of dark grey with white scrawled
lines of crystal etching through its surface. This was the point,
he stood at the center, his feet surrounded by the crystal etching,
which in response swirled to life at his presence, binding him with
ancient magic.</p>
<p class="western">A last glance down revealed the pattern
forming in the rock, words long forgotten wrote themselves around
the outer circle, a structure formed inside of the words, linking
each line of grain together. Until Vindec was stood in the center
of a hexagon, held by a binding talisman, surrounded by the seven
points of Logris which would protect him. The words were the names
of his spirit protectors, seven names, one for each point of the
pattern. He raised his hands to the sky in greeting.</p>
<p class="western">Far away in the cavern that had been the
witch's home his body mimicked his actions, its arms also raised.
Before the body of Vindec the Lifestone glowed, swelling in power,
as though tensing its self ready too perform. Many actors have
stood awed by their coming entry onto the stage, the stone was no
different.</p>
<p class="western">It was alive for the first real time since
its creation. Soon it would perform and everything about and around
it would change forever. The stone of power lived. Within it,
aiding it, resided the witch, she too was a part of the coming
magic. She that was the entity written of in black blood, in the
deep caverns of the dark places, she was the dark that would bring
light! She the witch, like the stone was now immortal.</p>
<p class="western">The sky blue electric light emanating from
within the stone began to change, it brightened and flickered
settling into a steady beat, casting long shadows as its entity
filled out the room, pulsing now in time with Vindec's heartbeat, a
pulse unified, a mind and spirit of stone joined. Out across the
distant plains standing in the circle of protection, the spirit
form of Vindec began to glow. Blue light flittered around his body,
creating a dome within the restrictions of his protection, slowly
his arms lowered, then reaching out he pointed, his arms spread
wide encompassing the valley to each rearing pinnacle of the high
ancient rocks which formed the valley sides.</p>
<p class="western">His fingers flowed together forming into
single bulbous balls of blue light. His head raised looking at a
point a mile infront of him, then without further a due the light
departed from his hands, surging outwards until it reached two
exactly opposite points on the rim sides. Vindec's head, now thrown
back as though in agony, but without pain, stared at the sky,
calling out the names of the creatures that would protect his
feeble entity from the ancient power he had and was unleashing on
the world.</p>
<p class="western">At the cliff sides the globules of blue
surged, playing and dancing in a perfectly formed fireworks
display, before burrowing into the cliff edges. Lightning flared,
but not in the sky above the world, but through the ground,
reaching into the rock, forming into twin points of power. Vindec
lowered his upturned face, looking forward once more, feeling the
power within bubbling upwards until it rocketed out from his fixed
eyes, shooting like stars across the night. Blue rockets flared for
a second, haloing his head before streaking forward and away.
Together each individual pulse contacted the distant ground,
joining in a lightening storm of unification, before much like
their predecessors they burrowed into the ground, forming the last
of the three points of power, the anchor points between the mortal
and immortal worlds.</p>
<p class="western">Beneath the ground hidden from mortal eyes,
yet seen and watched by the spirit of Vindec the three points
sought each other out. The triangle was formed; the portal was
open, but not yet stable. Rocks tore at themselves plowing through
the earth that separated them; closing together as the light had
closed, forming into a valley which rose high above the center dias
in which Vindec stood. All around him the ground moved, the grass
died, as life for vegetation was now impossible. Birds which had
nested and now reside, all rose into the air, their squawks
ricocheting from the rising rock faces were driven from their homes
or remained and died where they nested.</p>
<p class="western">Creatures of all shapes and sizes died in the
upheavals. A snake lucky to be far enough away for the points of
granitary collision hissed its anger and fear at Vindec as it
skittered past him. Deer raced for the only existing exit, seeking
safety from the magic unleashed by him. The birds circled, watching
the scene unfold below them. At the selected point, one mile
exactly from where Vindec stood, and at the exact place he had been
watching a dark smudge in the rock slowly materialized. It grew in
proportion to the newly created valleys height, opening up,
becoming a massive cave, which led not into the rock behind it, but
into the abyss of time. A place from which few if any that had been
dispatched into it had ever escaped.</p>
<p class="western">In the cavern, inside of the mountain that
had once been the witch's home, the stone had stopped pulsing. Now
it perceived the opening, now it began to brighten. The shadows it
had previously formed vanished. The rock surrounding it glowed, not
only on the inside of the cavern but through its ancient walls,
setting the place on fire but with a cold light. The power reached
out, aiding the spirit it had insured were dispatched. Vindec's
body stood motionless before the Lifestone, swathed by the light,
an empty husk with its essence out there performing for the stone,
being used by the stone! Had the body been conscious it would have
heard a laugh splatter around the room, a female laugh, as the
witch within the stone reached the peak she had so long sought?</p>
<p class="western">The dark cave entry existed; a link from
their world into a place of nowhere, the abyss was open and ready.
Vindec lowered his arms, turning away from the dark, looking along
the valley, reaching out with his mind to assess the desires that
raged before him burning in the minions of the dark one. Only the
darkest thoughts could compel the chosen into the entry, not his
dark thoughts, but their own. He spread his hands wide encompassing
the ground before and to either side of them all, missing no one,
pulling them that should come towards him and onwards.</p>
<p class="western">Ranks of creatures waited, at the exact
moment that their master decreed to be the time for the attack.
They stood twitching and waiting, surrounded by foe's but so far
unresisting. Not a single arrow has been fired since the surge had
began, every one, creature, human, elf or dwarf stood ready, but
the time had not yet arrived, something had changed! Death filled
the air, an impending death, an impending slaughter but the time
still has not arrived.</p>
<p class="western">When a call finally arrived, it was not as
the milling minions of the dark one expect, it was not a call to
slaughter it was instead a call to retreat. It had power and
demanded their instant obedience; they turned to face the mountains
each feeling the call and each was drawn towards it. The darkest of
them moved first, passing through the others, leading the way, as
they responded to the demand that only they could feel, a demand
that they attend unhurriedly, but without resistance a demand that
drew then near.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Nailstead slowly stood up from the crouch,
the huddled low position he had adopted when his control had been
shattered from him. His head recovered faster than his body, pain
filled and throbbed in his mind, but slowly he drove the pain away,
regaining some of his composure. The attack had been unexpected; it
had caught him unawares and therefore unprepared to defend
himself.</p>
<p class="western">The force used against him had shattered
through his magic, powering it into the ground, and from there it
had thrust back to impact deep into his thoughts. The witch, he
managed to think, somehow the witch is still alive and fighting
back! His anger began to build lifting his mind, driving out the
shadows, getting a hold like kindling to a fire, soon he would be
fully returned to himself and then he would fight back. Deep inside
his mind the fires of rage stoked themselves; he stands now,
looking out over the valley.</p>
<p class="western">A glance back showed him that the cliff top
had moved. Where there had been open land leading into his
mountains, there now was a closed blind valley with blackness
living at its center. Something from within the deepening dark
pulled at his mind, it called to him, it demanded that he attend to
it. Far Below spread across the open plain his minions had turned
as one; he reached out, touching one then another, trying to enter
into their thoughts. Even the simplest creature of the thoughtless,
mindless many, now resisted his minds contact, they to his horror
refused to listen to his commands. He has lost control over them!
He sensed the pull drawing them slowly towards the new
blackness.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Inaction is the road to doom; Nailstead was
not now ready to accept that this is the road down which fate
decrees that he should walk. He can feel a power reaching across
the skies, a dark but at the sametime, a light power, emanating
from beyond the dark road and up, much higher than the plains, much
more distant than his human enemies. The witch, realisation
explodes in his mind, the witch lives! She is in her cave right
now, still breathing and he can feel her attacking him, stealing
his minions, taking them away. He has lost all control over his
life; he would not accept the usurpation of his right to rule for a
second time. His mind formed the thoughts, and as he thinks, his
eyes seek out a means to his end, desperation and fear drive a last
desperate bid to defeat those that oppose him.</p>
<p class="western">High in the sky above the clouds, mighty
wings beat at the thin air, ancient evil creatures circled above
the valley in confusion, sitting astride the creatures were many
riders that were no longer charging into battle. At the periphery
of the gathering there waited one, He is an armed deadly fighter,
one of the many that had formed the back bone of Nailstead's aerial
army. Nailstead reached out to the living cloud of warriors and
beasts high above him, he felt rather than saw the growing desire
in them, soon the black flesh cloud would plummet from the air,
drawn into the new black hole, there to be lost to him and this
world. Even they are being called; he gave voice to his thoughts,
'I need them, without them there can only be failure and loss'.
Ignoring the call of the cave for him he looked up, focusing,
seeing one who was less drawn less intent, he the dark rider
offered Nailstead one last chance, a slight chance but there was no
doubting it, there remained an opportunity for him to put right
what he saw as wrong.</p>
<p class="western">He scanned each of the nearer creatures
seeking for a closer one; one that was still not fully committed to
obedience to the witches brew. He failed, there were none he could
manipulate; none he could control flew close to him. He accepted
the challenge of the distance to his only opportunity; he had found
what he sought riding the air at the periphery, a single rider, a
lone wolf floating through the clouds, confused and vulnerable.
Closing his mind to everything that might distract it, Nailstead
whispered the words. Out from his mind his will flowed, driven by
ancient curses, enforced by ancient dark magic and the strength of
his personality and the demand of his need, he reached up into the
sky attaching not to the rider, but to the simple mind of the
ridden.</p>
<p class="western">High above Nailstead the winged behemoth
stuttered in the air. Its head turned, ignoring the demand of the
rings fitted into its long snout, it ignored the tugs of leather
against those rings as its rider tried to turn its beaked head.
Looking down, it felt the power of the dark lord; its own desires
and those of its rider on its back were swamped out by the
demanding presence. Without any warning the creature's right wing
dipped, folding up tight to its body, twisting the creature into a
tumbling fall. The rider was catapulted outward, thrust into the
unresisting air to fall to the ground and die. The single spear he
held loosely in his right hand parted from his grip, and that to
fell.</p>
<p class="western">The creature now free of its rider stretched
out both wings, rhythmically it beat at the air, slowly the monster
reared up into the sky, looping over once and twisting around,
thrusting its body towards the master waiting for it far below. Its
eyes focused with ease on the standing cowled figure, its mind
locked faultlessly on the figure, nothing else mattered to the
creature, other than reaching the master.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The rider impacted the distant ground,
emitting a lingering last scream of terror filled realization
before death claimed him. He died instantly, splattered across the
back of a four legged lump of slow moving armoured flesh.</p>
<p class="western">His impact broke the creature's armour and
also the bones of its spine beneath that armour. Four legs splayed
out helplessly, a rounded, scale covered belly dug into the ground.
The creature was not dead, it would not die because of the impact,
but it would die eventually, once its shattered body had first
dehydrated in the baking sun, then it would freeze in the cold
depths of the night. It would certainly die, slowly and by inches,
with the body of the dead rider and his drying blood splayed across
its broken back.</p>
<p class="western">Nothing, not a one of its previous comrades
would offer, let alone be able to help it. None would think enough
to end its misery with a quick thrust of steel between the eyes,
all around it would continue, as they had been doing for hours, in
the long march towards the demanding voice that summoned them. Even
with such devastating injuries the creature tried to push itself
forward, attempting to answer the call. Its hind legs failed to
respond, as did its front legs, still it attempted to pull its self
towards the voice still echoing in its feeble mind. Only its head
moved in response, the paralysis caused by the impact extended up
to its thick armour covered neck.</p>
<p class="western">Some quirk of nature had created a different
pathway for the stimuli that drove both its lungs, and belly, these
were intact, the creature could breath just fine, it could feel
hunger perfectly, which soon would be all that it could feel. Soon
its agony would increase and days later it would die, finally, and
it would be at peace its suffering ended for all time. For now it
pressed into the ground, a shattered body, alone on the plain and
in growing agony.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead did not care, would not have
concerned himself even had he known, so far gone was his mind, so
driven by his mounting despair, terrified of failure. He would have
done nothing for the creature even had he known of its agony, to
him it was a means to his ultimate end, a means to power, it was a
creature that he considered to be totally expendable. Cannon fodder
for a general, not something that lived and felt, but instead to
him it was a weapon, one of many to be pointed and sent out, a
weapon called to his aid and programmed to obey him totally, a
weapon thrown away, discarded because of the need of its
commander.</p>
<p class="western">Creatures crowded together marching away from
the battle ground, stomping the dry earth cover flat, kicking up a
fine cloud of dense choking dust which they ignored, totally
indenting the earth with their passing. They did not know it, were
not aware, but they marched now on barren land which had so
recently been fertile, grass covered and flourishing, now it was
dead and would forever remain so. Tarnished forever by the deeds
and deaths committed on its surface.</p>
<p class="western">The marching army ignored the fallen amongst
them, desiring only to enter into the black which offered them so
much. Their master was now forgotten, driven from any of their
thoughts by the draw of the enchantment that leads them. Line after
line turned, wave after wave commenced marching always inwards into
the mountains, unknowingly marching out of the world of Elf, Man
and Dwarf, into something unknown and different. Each without care,
each feeling the right of the new direction, each drawn forever
forwards into the night into the new cavern created for them.</p>
<p class="western">The dying creature watched its companions
pass in an endless stream; it tried to move forward again and
again, but each effort by it failed. Its fate was different to
those around it, though it had no understanding of the word fate,
or the effect that it was to have on its pathetic life. All it
understood was the pull of the dark, continually dragging at its
mind, and the deep feeling of frustration at its immobility to
comply, which gnawed into its slow, simple mind. It was even
unaware of its imminent death, but that would soon change, as the
agony within built through the passing days and nights.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The black huge wings beat above his head, as
the now rider less creature drawn to comply with Nailstead's
bidding slowly settled towards the ground, lowering its long neck
before its master, eager only to please, to serve, to obey.
Nailstead mounted the creature, pulling himself along the tensile
steel muscled neck, until he could turn, he faced forwards, secure
in the saddle placed by the creatures pervious rider. He picked up
the reins, he pulled back sharply getting the creature's full
attention.</p>
<p class="western">Wings spread to either side of him; they
drove down, lifting the deformed dragon into the sky. Nailstead
turned the beasts head pointing it over the mountains, and with a
pointless kick to the creature's ridged side, he drove it forward.
Wings beat at the sky lifting the master higher; circling round and
round, corkscrewing upwards together, master and servant combined
and lifted until finally Nailstead could see beyond the mountains.
There in the far distance waited the cavern, within it he was
certain, stirring her witches brew was the she witch, kill her and
the battle could still be won. Kill the King and he by rite of law
became the true and only ruler once more, no longer the usurped.
None then would dare to challenge his right to the crown! This
battle is far from over as far as he was concerned; the beast
carried its burden, ignorant and uncaring of the desires that drove
that burden.</p>
<p class="western">Below him mindlessly out of control rows and
rows of his minions marched into the black. A final glance back and
he was away leaving them behind to face their fate. To him they
were nothing more than a means to obtain an end, a weapon to be
wielded and used to crush all that opposed him in any way.</p>
<p class="western">Passing high above the ridges, he watched the
processions passing far below as he crossed over the mountains. The
black road appeared before him, he bore to its left slightly. Below
him the dark lord viewed thousands of milling monstrosities, each
waiting for its turn to filter back through the mountain path, then
through the valley, finally to enter into the dark cave and there
to become just another incident recorded by history. Nailstead
ignored the masses beneath the beating wings; he instead was
searching the ground for one slave only. The human with the
deformities he had created, he saw him stood stock still, between
twin mountains of rocky flesh, looking forward.</p>
<p class="western">"Good." He whispered, 'Good,' he thought, as
he watched the emissary of his plan, reach back over his shoulder
to withdraw the weapon he had personally handed to him.</p>
<p class="western">"Soon, very soon," His voice soothed his
turmoil ridden mind, turning his attention once more towards the
mountain rearing before him, and the witch residing within it. A
witch he intended to kill, a witch that had to die if he was to
regain all that he had lost, all that had been taken away from
him.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The dwarf rode harder than at any other point
in his trip as he fast approached the lone tree. Clearly now he
could see his friend the King, the distance between them was
closing quickly, soon he would be dismounted by his King and all
will be well. Iffilditch raised his head followed by an arm, he had
noted the distant rider, and half watched it approach and now he
recognised the distinctive dwarf shape mounted on the animals back.
He raised an arm in greeting, waving the dwarf forward to join
them.</p>
<p class="western">To his side and slightly back was sitting the
King, he looked odd, but basically ok, his thoughts though seemed
confused to him, as sounded his speech, but now that the
confinement of his regal battle armour was removed, his breathing
seemed to be fast returning to normal.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf looked across the field of battle,
noting the creatures turning away, noting the up torn ground and
settling his eyes on the twin bodies of the rock troll. They moved
one then two steps forward, fear choked at the dwarf's throat; not
fear for his own life, but a deep fear for the Kings. The rock
trolls stopped, halting in mid-stride, their lumpy faces contorted
as though in pain, they turned towards each other, tolerance
vanishing; enemies met on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="western">Then and without warning they both sat, face
to face, thirty-feet between them, immobile, uncaring of anything
around them, it was as if they had just run out of energy, then sat
down and died! Twin heads bowed, massive heavy ridged eye brows
closed over tiny eyes, they ceased, possibly not dead the dwarf
realised, but certainly not a threat. He felt the tension which had
driven him this far slowly fade away. The choking tight grip of
fear wrapped around his throat faded then vanished, allowing him to
breathe easily for the first time in quite a while.</p>
<p class="western">He turned his attention back to the King and
the Elf, pulling back on the reins, slowing the panting nearly
exhausted horse to a regular trot and then down to a walk.
Thirty-feet from the King's side, something attracted his
attention. A movement half noticed out of the corner of one eye, a
peripheral specter rising up, where nothing threatening should
be.</p>
