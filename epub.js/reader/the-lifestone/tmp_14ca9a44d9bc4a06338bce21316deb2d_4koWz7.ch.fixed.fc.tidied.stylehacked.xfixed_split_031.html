<p class="western">Vindec stood on the lip of the upper most
square cut, looking down towards the hole in the ground, watching
as men and elves struggled to lift the twin halves of the heavy
metal ring, which would be used to create and support the wells
brick walls.</p>
<p class="western">The idea was simple, the ring is lowered into
place at the bottom of the well, then bricks and mortar are piled
up on its circular shape, creating the walls. Once they are in
place the diggers return, replacing the brickies and they dig down
below the ring. The ring sinks lower with the weight and the
removal of its earth supports, and then more bricks are added at
the top and the cycle is started again thus the hole in the ground
becomes lined with bricks to the bottom.</p>
<p class="western">This method allows for a great depth to be
dug out without the risk of the sides collapsing in, killing the
workers and destroying the new well. Layer after layer of bricks
are added, the weight grows the soil is removed, and slowly the
well penetrates deeper into the ground in a perfectly formed circle
of bricks and mortar covering over the rough of the diggers. This
is the way that all large deep wells are constructed, it is a tried
and tested method, and Vindec is certain that it is the only way to
precede without his using magic. For him to have created the space
using magic would have contaminated the area in a way that could
not be allowed. The old ways are the best ways and so it was lined
out and strengthened with bricks and lime mortar.</p>
<p class="western">Once the well reached thirty-five feet in
depth and the mortar had set then and only then could a hole be cut
into the brickwork of one side, and the construction of the large
chamber be re-commenced. The walls of the hollowed out tunnel and
the cavern at its end would also be lined out and an arched roof
created for strength. It took four weeks of digging and bricking to
reach the correct depth. The mortar was left for three days to
ensure that it was fully hardened before the side exit was created.
An arch of bricks was built into the wall, and the earth beyond the
arch watered flattened and allowed to dry, creating a smooth
surface against which the bricks were laid, the stone of the floor
when added helped to anchor the bricks, adding yet more strength to
the tunnel and eventually the cavern at its furthest end.</p>
<p class="western">Digging sideways is easier than digging down
the workers had discovered, but it has its own dangers. Roof
collapses had been the most obvious, so to ensure that the roof
remained intact, Pillars of stone were brought in, lowered down the
well then erected and set into place, each having square metal
plates driven between the top of the pillar and the soil of the
roof until they are secured; these plates of metal are called
dispersal plates by the builders. Once positioned correctly to the
top of the pillars and pressed hard into the soil they are mortared
into place, making a permanent roof support. Then the space is
brick lined and the construction expands, thus creating a sideways
piercing tunnel and eventually the room which Vindec so
desired.</p>
<p class="western">It was to be large, circular, with no other
entry but via the well. The men building it would know that, and so
the legend would exist of the place with no point, an inaccessible
room, with nothing of interest in it. Once the room was built
Vindec realised to the horror of the builders that he would order
that the empty room be bricked up again. Making sure that everyone
present was certain of its emptiness. Not that Vindec expected
anyone to be able to enter this place, unless they had the right to
enter into it. They would be dead long before they reached the
upper castle, let alone this inner sanctum of sanctums he had
overseen created.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Daylight broke to discover Vindec standing
beside two heavily muscled human males, each holding one end of a
huge saw between them. All three watched as two more human males
hammered at the stone plinth built around the base of the ancient
tree, the tree to which the King had been impaled against by the
black blade.</p>
<p class="western">All wore heavy working gloves, their clothes
were thick, protective and around their ankles binding tape had
been wound. The men hammering at the stonework also wore helmets,
originally designed for mortal combat, with tiny eye slits out of
which to see, even this limited vision was again covered with clear
glass. This had been provided and insisted upon by Vindec, adding
to the strange appearance of each, as their hammers flashed up and
down through the early morning sunlight.</p>
<p class="western">Chunks of stone splintered and flew; blocks
calved away revealing the tree trunk beneath. The men were careful
not to hammer the ancient wood, but hitting only against the
captive's stone plinth. Once the last piece of material had been
shattered from that plinth the men stepped back, they laid down
their implements, and turned together as one to face the magician,
finally they removed their helmets. With their portion of this
endeavor completed, Vindec released them and they departed.</p>
<p class="western">Two men stood silently a saw length and a saw
separating them, having watched they bent forward, with one hand
they picked up the helmets and put them on, then each stepped
forward. They understand what they have to do, and how careful they
had to be to do it and avoiding skin contact with the wood or the
stone. One touch! Vindec had explained will ensure a painful death,
with his warning ringing in their ears they approached the trunk,
they were volunteers.</p>
<p class="western">Taking up positions directly opposite to each
other they raised their single blade, turning it side on to the
bark, so that the sharp brand new teeth of the saw could cut a
perfect entry. Back and forward the blade traveled between them,
each man pulling at exactly the perfect time, dragging the sharp
teeth into and eventually cutting through the wood.</p>
<p class="western">With the last cut sideways the men extracted
the blade, repositioning it five inches higher than the first cut,
but this time with an intersecting downwards angle to the teeth,
then slowly, so as to get a good grip in the wood they eased the
blade once more into its to and fro cutting action. The blade did
its job, its razor sharp, highly polished new metal teeth, bit
deep, cutting at an angle this time. Soon the teeth crossed over
the original cut, the men removed the steel. A wedge of wood was
then driven from the tree stump with a large mallet and the tree
began, as it should, to lean; its trunk no longer able to support
its weight.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec watched as the experienced tree
fellers brought down the ancient symbol, the tree that had always
guarded the black road. A road that was now gone, guarded by a tree
that would soon be removed. It fell in a branch snapping tumble to
the ground. The men looked across at him and waited, not sure of
what he might want them to do next? Vindec looked on knowing that
in a few short hours the remains of the tree would be repositioned,
that its link with the dark road and the Kings blood would ensure
its union, he dismissed the cutters, just as he had dismissed the
hammerer's.</p>
<p class="western">Soon the tree will be attended too; he looked
out across the plain towards a single distant point, looking for
the signs of those he must now await. Dust rose into the air,
distant but closing at a regular pace; soon he smiled, glancing
towards the distant circle, very soon!</p>
<p class="western">From within the dust a wagon drawn by four
heavy horses appeared, behind and to the sides walked twin columns
of children, each paired, each holding another's hand. Teachers and
parents followed the children and all followed the wagon as it
rolled across the plain and to the waiting Vindec. The wagon halted
before the magician who pointed to a spot twenty-feet further on
and closer to the ring of black.</p>
<p class="western">The driver eased his horses forward
positioning the wagon, he climbed down, glancing once towards the
magician and the children and the distant waiting adults, before
turning to face his horses and beginning to remove their tack,
separating them from the wagon. He linked each horse to another
before removing the final one, which he mounted and with a half
wave, which he had intended to be a cheery goodbye to all; but
which faded as he lifted his hands towards the solemn, stationary
columns, he rode away taking all four animals with him. Leaving
behind him the loaded flat backed wagon, and the children.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec raised his arms in greeting and the
solemnity fell away, the children rushed forward eager to greet
him, they understood, they and him were the only people present
that did understand. Each child has been selected and their
presence demanded during the previous night. Each has willingly
accepted the challenge that lay before them, now they stood as one
looking towards the magician, waiting and eager to understand
further.</p>
<p class="western">Behind them parents and teachers watched in
confused awe, they did not understand, have not been called, but
had followed their charges as they had gathered together and
departed in their twin columns, joining on their march the wagon
and falling in behind it. The parents were exhausted; they had
walked some miles and over rough terrain whilst following their
children. Teachers had tried to turn or halt the columns, but
always failed; the children just marched on seemingly tireless. The
adults followed growing more fearful of the destination.</p>
<p class="western">Peace flowed from the raised fingers of
Vindec, the adults felt it seeping into their bodies, swamping
their concerns, adding them to the power that the children gave to
him. The time has come for another step forward; the children had
arrived and with them, those that were unknowingly to act as
assistants to the children, those that could lift more that any
child. The adults would have a use in this thought Vindec, though
their presence is not deemed necessary to his plan their presence
was welcome all the same.</p>
<p class="western">Twenty children approached one side of the
fallen tree stump, another twenty formed up on the opposite side,
as one they reach down to the blood infused wood and effortlessly
picked it up. Others pull wooden saw horses from the wagon back,
and plant them ready to receive the tree. Still others pick up or
pulled out boxes, opening them and distributing the shavers inside.
Each child took a metal shaver, holding it by its twin handles.
Between the handles is a single razor sharp blade, covered and
pointing away from the child holding the tool! Each child formed up
around the saw horses, whilst leaving enough room for those
carrying the tree to its place of dismemberment. The branches rest
outstretched on the supports, the trunk reached out lengthways on
four more supports; the children closed. The tree cannot hurt them,
they are the world's innocents, with each having been chosen by the
Lifestone as it searched the minds of the Elvin population. The
Lifestone drew them to this point. The Lifestone imbued each of
them with the energy and the stamina to complete their mission.
They are the first chosen one's of the Lifestone, the first of a
long line of chosen one's, eager to serve its will.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec stands silent, leaving the children to
act as they see fit, trusting them completely. Parents approach the
wagon now, reaching in and removing sacking, then a tent follows
which they erect. Food bags and boxes with pastries follow, all
taken into the tent, water barrels are placed on tables made from
saw horses, all is made ready.</p>
<p class="western">The children begin, each selecting a portion
of the supported tree, each holding their blades out ready to
dissect the body of the tree, which will then be gathered up as
shavings and small splinters and placed into the sacks to be
carried away by the adults, towards the circle of black road
surrounding the lands of the newly created castle, there to be
deposited at its edge un opened. No parent can touch the wood, nor
walk on the soil covered black surface, only the innocent can
defeat the dark magic that resides expanding its reach but
contained within, and they are in numbers plentiful enough to
ensure that no parent or teacher will need to touch the poisoned
land.</p>
<p class="western">The shaving began, the gathering began, and
soon the first full sacks arrived, where yet more children
scattered the shavings between the white painted posts, which
Vindec had used to mark the circles inner and outer edges. Children
walked over the black now soil covered surface without injury. They
layered the wood shavings onto the soil, coating it, slowly the
evil became buried. Behind the line of children, distributing the
wood shards, adults formed up, taking spades from the wagon and
began to shovel the piled up soil from the builder's excavations
onto the wood, adding yet another thicker covering layer.</p>
<p class="western">Once all the wood in a section was coated in
soil the adults could walk upon the soils surface, their weight
driving the shards deeper into the black forcing both to meld
together. Slowly as the day progressed the circle turned a shade of
brown with its wood coating, then as more dirty soil covered the
wood it turned a pleasant normal looking grey, finally between
Vindec's flags was a circle of earth slightly banked up but clearly
a circle.</p>
<p class="western">The entrance point into the circle remained
untouched. The sacks of wood needed to cover it, like the rest were
added to the piles of black material waiting to seal the circle,
the soil from within was added to create a third pile so that all
was ready. Vindec watched in silence as the magic of innocence set
the stage for the magic of ancient prophesy, and a single magician,
him.</p>
<p class="western">The afternoon faded as the last shovels of
earth fell within the flags. Vindec then gathered the children in a
circle, and before their eyes he produced the most delicious
looking, honey sweet cakes, which any present be they adult or
child, had ever dreamt of. For the rest of their lives those
present would remember both the taste and the way that all
weariness faded as they eat. Parents would find that the cakes they
eat that afternoon strengthened not only their bodies, returning
vigor to strained over worked muscles, but they also created a bond
which would live with each person, a bond linking each adult to
each child, a bond of having shared an experience that no other
could ever share again.</p>
<p class="western">They, the chosen ones, had in effect and by
their presence selected others, and now all shared in the bonus of
magic, gifted to them by the grateful magician. They were the ones
that had created the place which would protect all, they were the
Lifestone's emissaries, chosen to create and then share in the
bounty of peace.</p>
<p class="western">Revitalized, feeling as though they had slept
the day away and woken in the arms of a holiday, all present stood,
bowed to the magician, who humbled by their thanks returned their
bow, and then they formed up, not it two's or columns, but in
groups, as friends, united they strolled rather than marched away
from the place they had created.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec watched as the day's light fell, he
watched as the darkness eclipsed them, then the time had arrived
and he had much to do that night, some of it required magic, some
of it no magic could ever affect.</p>
