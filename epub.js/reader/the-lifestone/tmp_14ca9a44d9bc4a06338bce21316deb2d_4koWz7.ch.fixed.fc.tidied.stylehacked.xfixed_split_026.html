<p class="western">There is one other person foretold of in the
legends, one more critical to the completion of the reign of the
dark one than even himself. I need to know whether the future is as
it has been foretold, or has a catastrophe unfurled and is the
future now placed in disruption and mire. I glance towards the
Lifestone, knowing that a union with it once more is impossible to
avoid, stepping towards it, trying to ignore the dark threatening
ranting emanating from the cage of power; with a slight waft of my
hand silence falls on the room. Nailstead is still ranting, but now
the sound he is making only fills his temporary prison, his word
and curses silenced to the outer world.</p>
<p class="western">'Let him entertain himself' I thought, as I
approached the nemesis and savior of the world I love. The crystal
Lifestone waits for me, knowing that I will attend to it, now and
for as long as breath fills my body, I am fated to attend to it
though not to be controlled by it, I have decided.</p>
<p class="western">The Lifestone welcomes my presence, so the
thought must have been formed in my own mind and not presented by
it to me. I reach out, placing my hands to either side of the
ancient power source; not because I need contact to commune with
it, but because I will need the support its physical presence
offers to my body, as my mind departs both it and from within this
cavern. The stone pulses just once and then my mind leaves my body
behind my essence free floats separate but controlled.</p>
<p class="western">I am high above the cavern, floating towards
the distant field of battle, I can see forever or so it seems,
though forever is an indefinable distance I tell myself. Time to
work, to seek, to learn the truth of this our destiny, from high
above I watch the last of the creatures passing through the valley.
They marched in peace now, their thoughts fully fixed, their
attention set only on obtaining their new home, the open abyss I
have opened for them all. They are exactly as they should be, an
enemy that is no more, a force that has been changed for the
better. That is until the dark lord joins with them once more, then
they will return to being what they always have been, but by then
it will be to late for them all.</p>
<p class="western">Below I can see the troops gathering around a
single mounted figure, sitting astride and looking regal, mounted
on a pure white horse, now being led towards the distant elfin
castle by a dwarf. Him I know, next to him, carrying the black
blade tightly wrapped in a thick cloth walks the Elf, Iffilditch.
The weapon though wrapped still glows with the evil it contains.
The King looks well, which is not as I expected or hoped it would
be!</p>
<p class="western">My mind sought the future; The King sitting
inset on his throne, something he rarely chooses to do. All around
him stand his followers, council members listening in rapt awe as
he speaks of the peace to come. A lone rider races across the plain
heading for the cavern I now called home, sent I sense to fetch the
witch. He will be disappointed, access will not be granted to the
rider and he will return in despair to his King, having failed in
his duty.</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch kneels before the King carefully
holding out the dark weapon. I notice something odd, a bandage, not
a large swathing, but all the same a bandage. It is wrapped tightly
around the King's wrist, passing between his thumb and finger's.
Time flickers forward; The King stands raising his good hand
demanding silence, a knight his head turned down kneels before the
master. This is as it should be, the knight has returned to
himself, the question in my mind is, has this knight completed his
duty to fate, and legend, before being returned, or has he like the
rider will, have failed?</p>
<p class="western">For a second the babble continues before
finally falling silent, the knight raises his head, the audience
looked at their liege, all there witness the first thrust of fates
given hand. They watch as the King, their King wobbles slightly,
then his face contorts before them in a display of agony. He
clutches at his bandage trying to rip it from his wrist, but the
wrapping is too tight, and secured with metal pins, thus he also
fails. The weapon of blackness pulses, it has been placed on a
table and ignored I note, it resides on its table to the King's
right, feeling the growth of its canker rising, flooding the King's
blood with its poison, it duty done the blade waits.</p>
<p class="western">Fate is as it had been decreed and a new evil
has been created and released to torment the living. My mind found
peace, all is not lost, the King is dying! Not swiftly but by
inches, the poison now suffuses his body, spearing slowly through
his tissue; he is lost, all hope of survival has departed from him.
As I watch unseen, he falls back to be caught in the outstretched
arms of his throne, he reaches for his knife, slicing into the
cloth, cutting it from his wrist, not knowing that it is to late.
Seeing for the first time the black swelling now revealed, a dark
canker growing out of a slight wound, a death waiting to be
claimed.</p>
<p class="western">Panic broke out, the Dwarf, Knight and Elf
surge forward, each reaching pointlessly for their weapons,
determined to protect their King. There is no protection available
for the disease that pulses through him, robbing him of his royal
state. Denigrating him to be the long fated and the first chosen
one, who much like me, must forever fight the evil presences on
this world. The King is dying, and all will be well, all will be as
it has been prophesied so long ago.</p>
<p class="western">I left the future returning to my own time,
thence to my cavern home. Sealing the entry so that the rider who
must fail, will fail, once he arrives; I enter into my cavern home.
All is as I have left it, except that Nailstead has expounded his
total armoury of magic and curses against the walls of his prison,
and like the rider to come, he too has failed. His head slowly
raises at my arrival, drawn from his slump in the place set aside
for the defeated, a dark place that he has been visiting. His
thoughts returned, but without the darkness that previously
encapsulated them. I let him speak.</p>
<p class="western">He talks of sorrow and death, of life and
destiny, of the future and the darkness, he speaks in ways and
languages long forgotten or never learnt, he speaks clearly, but
mostly he has for now accepted his fate. It has become clear to him
and he accepts it, now he is reaching out with his words which were
intended only to sooth my ears and calm my concerns and my thoughts
at what I must do, at what he must do.</p>
<p class="western">We will I know meet again and again, then he
will have altered at each meeting through the coming time, then he
will be my mortal enemy, but now he reaches out to me as a friend
as a companion in magic, as a part of a growing legend. The dark
one would forever remain in my memory as being a friend, one that I
must always fight and defeat, but still a friend. The time has come
for him, my lost friend to be cast down. It falls to me to thrust
him from this world, and start once more the progression of
fate.</p>
<p class="western">The crystal cage lifts from the floor,
carried by my will alone, out and away, carried to join the last
residue of his minions, destined, as are they, to enter into the
abyss. He floats, contained in my cage of power into the cavern of
the abyss, as behind him the last rays of daylight fade, an
illumination of the abyss killed by the walls closing behind him.
Held captive by my energy, which like the light of day failed to
reach into the abyss, turning fragile as the last vestiges of
freedom faded, an energy that now could not contain him, could no
longer stand against the weakest thrust of Nailstead. It shattered
at his first touch, freeing him into the murky world of the dark
abyss that for centuries untold will become his prison.</p>
<p class="western">The light disappears, the magic has been
completed, the abyss is now closed, Nailstead is banished from my
world, and so for a time peace will return, but then there are the
prophecies, and they all tell of his returning. Of battles to come,
of heroes and heroines of life and death and of the final prophesy,
which to me is swirled in murk and mystery. I have my role to play,
my duty to comply with, and I Vindec have accepted my fate.</p>
