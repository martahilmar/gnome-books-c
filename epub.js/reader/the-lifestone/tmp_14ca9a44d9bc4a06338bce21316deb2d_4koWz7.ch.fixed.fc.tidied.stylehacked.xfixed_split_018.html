<p class="western">"What the hell!" The voice dragged me from my
memories back to the cold battlefield; I half turned, looking
towards the voice. He, the speaker, was stood twenty-feet from me,
staring forward, his mouth hanging open, his arm reaching up and
pointing towards the sky above the cloud box. I turned; Iffilditch
was already looking that way, his arm reaching out to grasp me
intending to turn my attention. He need not have bothered; the old
sergeant-at-arms had said enough to turn my attention. I looked,
hesitant concerned at what I might see.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Three blood red spears of light rocketed out
of nowhere, flashing upwards from the distant mountains, their
launch point concealed from us by the raging snow storm, until they
passed around and above the cloud box, which was what the sergeant
was pointing up at. My eyes tracked the last of the three as it
headed towards my aerial troops. 'Nailstead' I swore to myself,
damn him, what now?</p>
<p class="western">The rockets of light powered upwards passing
scant inches from an owl that luckily for it had spotted the fast
approaching light, it (the owl) swerved in the air pirouetting to
its right at the sametime, lifting a powerful wing and then
dropping sharply away, thus avoiding the missiles flight path.
Unfortunately the wing rider sitting astride the owl had been
looking elsewhere and so was caught unprepared for the sudden and
catastrophic aerobatics of the owl.</p>
<p class="western">He, the rider, was spun and twisted, his
saddle straps must have split allowing him to tumble from his
partners back. With a scream (I imagined) he tumbled, thrust and
falling outwards and down, catapulted from the feathery back out
into the chill un-supporting air. Arms flapping, useless for
flight, but clearly depicting his fear, for all to see. The owl
wheeled again turning a tight circle, trying to correct its
disturbed flight, as the light exploded past roaring upwards still.
I watched the coming death of the owl's rider, certain that nothing
now could save him.</p>
<p class="western">An owl lower in the flight pattern was
climbing upwards to rejoin its compatriots, having been examining
the cloud top, the climbing creature saw the tumbling rider,
veering sharply the owl headed for a collision, at the last second
the owl beat hard against the air, extending its sharp talons
outwards from its body and clutching at the falling rider, catching
him, snatching him from certain death, either by the impact of his
fall or by the evil that battled for survival below him, within the
cloud formed box.</p>
<p class="western">Wings strained, never designed to carry a
load of this weight, owl's are powerful, they can fly long and hard
and are ferocious fighters in the air, but they have only got a
limited ability to carry weight and this one was both young
looking, and already fully loaded. It could not hold the rider for
long and definately could not climb much higher than it already
had. Others of its kind swooped in. With the perfect timing of the
skilled hunter, the owl released the rider, flipping him forwards
and up directly into the path of a swooping bird, which like the
first plucked the rider from the air, Its dive provided the impetus
to countered the sudden extra weight, allowing the owl and its
rider cargo to lift upwards, four muscle driven wing beats and the
owl was finished, it released the rider again, casting him towards
another and then another, until finally the riders own owl had been
able to dive and prepare to catch its companion.</p>
<p class="western">The last owl released its grip, spinning the
rider still higher as its own owl dived down. With an agility I
would not have believed possible, the rider pirouetted through the
air and collided with the saddle still fixed to its mounts back by
a single restraint. Fingers grasped at the leather straps, pulling
up, the rider threw a leg over the saddle regaining his seat then
hastily he secured his broken strapping. He was saved and by the
most spectacular series of aerobatic maneuvers a proud King has
ever been privileged to witness.</p>
<p class="western">"Wow, did you see that!" the sergeant spoke
out again for the first time since the light had dislodged the
rider. All around him men raised their heads, cheering to the sky,
cheering to the owls, and cheering to the survivor who had returned
to the fight. Wings beat at the air circling the now reseated
rider, words of encouragement must have been screeched between them
but the winds of the storm eradicated them from our hearing. The
sweeping birds, each with their battle hardened warriors sitting
astride of their backs circled once and then climbed back up to
rejoin the main battle group. One of their own had been saved from
a certain death but what counted more was getting back to the
war.</p>
<p class="western">I looked at Iffilditch, who had a broad smile
plastered across his face. My elf was obviously much encouraged by
the display we had been treated to, as I admitted to myself, was
I.</p>
<p class="western">The red flairs continued upwards past the
main body of the flight before exploding like so many fireworks,
flashing displays of power across the clear skies. Scattering
outwards those flares began to fall. The owls, now aware, easily
avoided the red energy, but could do nothing to halt the falling of
them. The power tumbled, sparking and expanding, forming a sheet of
lightening power, which coated the black top of the storm cloud.
The cloud broke apart, rent into smaller segments of snowing cloud,
before being blown away by a wind that had risen from the distant
mountains.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead was about his business, he had
responded effectively to the witch's first assault. Many of his
minions were now nothing but frozen corpses littering the
battlefield, but many thousand of them still lived and were forming
up as the snow storm died away. As visibility across the battle
plain cleared, it became obvious that Nailstead was still pouring
troops along the dark road. He had ignored the storm and its
murderous effect, he had forced his troops outwards from the
valleys causing them to form up on the plain ready for battle.</p>
<p class="western">My mounted lancers had been unable to resist
and had fought a valiant defense, allowing my foot soldiers to
withdraw to the sides. Leaving a clear path to the center for
Nailstead's creatures to occupy. They were still boxed up within
the plain but the pressure of mounting numbers could only cause an
expansion in their position. Eventually they would be so compacted
that their only option would be to surge forwards and outwards,
engaging my troops in direct conflict.</p>
<p class="western">The battle had reached a very real point of
no return, the winner would be he that controlled the surrounding
area in an hour or so, and that could be either Nailstead or I. The
snow blinded me with its glare, light shattered causing me to
squint and then the scene before me vanished; I was back in my
room, sitting opposite to Iffilditch listening to his report; the
battle forgotten, still as far as my thoughts were concerned far in
the future. I had the beginnings of a slight head ache.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"So Sire I slipped swiftly over the side of
the wagon and faded away from sight!"</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">I shook my head trying to dispel my growing
headache as it was fast forming behind my eyes, whilst at the
sametime listening to Iffilditch. His report on our enemy's
strengths and possible weaknesses was important. I knew that, I
desperately wanted to understand everything, yet his face swam
slightly before me, then thankfully it settled and remained still.
My headache faded away as I looked up eager now to listen, giving
him my fullest attention.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">"I do not believe that I was seen leaving the
wagons side sire, so the dwarf should be as safe as it was possible
to be, whilst covertly entering into an enemy's encampment. He as I
am sure you know Sire is a very resourceful dwarf, so I had little
worry for him. I crept from the track, crawling in the dust,
smoothly, almost snake like, using all of my skills to blending
into my surroundings. The wolf followed me, not to close, not
drawing attention to me, but close enough all the same."</p>
<p class="western">"Having departed from the roadway and having
sought cover in the low bushes, I turned to watch the wagon trudge
on. The wolf stood by my side looking first at the wagon, then he
turned his attention to the rising ground behind us. Ground he
appeared to understand that we would have to enter into, and climb
up through, if we were going to leave this plain behind us,
safely."</p>
<p class="western">"The climb upwards started easily, passing
from light scrub, through dense scrub, and then into pine trees, a
forest of large mature pine trees at that. The natural rise of the
ground shaded the trees from the winds allowing them to grow
straight and tall. They hide our passage very effectively from any
air born searchers, but walking silently through and across a
carpet of dead, very dry pine needles, is a near
impossibility."</p>
<p class="western">"Speed seemed to be our best option, as
stealth was blatantly impossible. The forest climbed up the side of
a ridge and we ploughed forwards. The wolf leading the way; he
seemed to have a clear idea of where we were heading, which I know
seems odd, but that Sire, that is the way it was. This wolf always
seemed to know what it was about, and conveyed a feeling of
confidence, and direction, that even I failed to find."</p>
<p class="SWsoftchapter"> </p>
<p class="western">"The pine forest began to fade out, the
ridge-edge appeared above us and I slowed our accent, wanting to
remain this side of it, un-silhouetted by the fast fading days
light. We would cross that ridge only once darkness had blanketed
the land. The wolf picked a spot against a rock cliff, about twenty
feet tall and in a recess, which was not quite a cave but would
offer us considerable shelter. A cliff-edge overhung the recess
adding yet more of a feeling of security. I decided that I might be
able to light a small fire and infact did! Eating a hot meal for
the first time since departing from the glade with the dwarf in the
wagon, brightened my spirits."</p>
<p class="western">"Darkness quickly settled around us, the food
went down well with both the wolf and me, leaving us both feeling
full and I think content. I sat back against the recessed wall to
think. The wolf decided to nudge up close to me, placing his shaggy
head on my outstretched legs and seemingly falling asleep. Four
hours later the wolf stirred, growling low in his throat, waking me
from a troubled dream in which I was drowning in black cloaked
wraiths, that insisted on stabbing me with wagon staves, taken from
hundreds of broken wagon wheels."</p>
<p class="western">"Alert, I watched as the wolf turned to face
outwards, then slowly, his hackles rose up and he still continued
growling quietly, the creature moved away from me. My bow filled my
hands, an arrow knocked ready to fire; as I followed the creature
towards the distant ridge above us. If we were going to cross that
ridge without being seen, now was as good a time as any. Crawling
slowly upwards to the point edge of grey rock, listening hard,
unable to see because of the night, I followed the wolf."</p>
<p class="western">"He angled further to our left finding a cut
through which he slipped, his growling having now fallen silent, I
could vaguely make out his silhouette against the dull red glowing
skyline. That stopped me in my tracks, my belly contracting against
the ground, why was the sky line red it should be black, pitch
black? I crawled forwards some more, sideling up next to the now
crouched wolf."</p>
<p class="western">"The ground remained flat for two-hundred
feet then it dropped away in a series of rough shelves, with us
being at the very highest point, it sire allowed us to see down
into the valley below. It wasn't very wide, certainly not like the
plain the dwarf and I had crossed; it was more like a deep cut into
a farmers field with us at the top and with thousands of fires
snaking along the far side, casting their red glow upwards."</p>
<p class="western">"Shadows Sire, flitted between the fires,
voices distorted by the valley echoed of the far wall and
rebounded, but even more distorted, creating a cacophony of the
weird. Wolf seemed tense but not in an immanent threat to us way,
more angered by the evil that resided out and down there below us.
I watched carefully trying to obtain a body count, but I failed
sire, as there was just too many creatures spread out for me to
count. What they were I haven't got a clue, the light was just to
bright in places, which causes deep shadows in others, which was in
turn where most of the creatures were sitting around the leaping
flames."</p>
<p class="western">"To my right wagons arrived, a long line of
wagons, hundreds of wagons, each laidened to its roof with battle
equipment. Wagon after wagon, a neat endless line of the oxen
pulled transports, trundled below us, heading past the foot
soldiery camped passively around their fires waiting. Where they
were going, who they were equipping and when, I could not tell, but
for the hour sire that we watched the column passing, there was
never more than a few feet of break space between them!"</p>
<p class="western">"Crossing the ridge had been my intent, then
heading further over and then turning towards home, picking up the
distant track on which I had entered this world of mountains and
valleys, that idea seemed impossible to me given what I had viewed,
the risk of us being seen and therefore caught was just to great.
My options were now limited I realised, I could turned left or
right. Left offered us no gain in potential, as it would take us
back towards the encampment we had first encountered, that left us
with right sire."</p>
<p class="western">"The wolf had already decided; he had stood
up and faced towards our right. I crawled back until standing was a
safe option, and with the wolf leading we tracked the slow moving
wagons in the valley beneath us. Sire we walked, traveling as fast
as the ground and the lack of light would allow, heading off to our
right. At least were moving in the right direction, but for how
long I hadn't got a clue."</p>
<p class="western">"The ground slowly shelved, we were walking
down hill all the time, soon I realised we would encounter the
track way below us and then what? Crossing still seemed to be a
dangerous possibility but one that might become essential. The
wagons ploughed on, out of our sight but well within our hearing.
Wolf faultlessly guiding our route, he seemed to know the best and
easiest ways past each obstacle and only occasionally did we
encounter cross ways ridges, which had to be climbed over. They
were not difficult in their own right but each raised our profile
should someone or thing be looking in the right direction at the
right time. Trees began to litter our route, low scrub grew coarse
and stunted, obviously affected by the openness of the ground, and
I presume the poor soil covering; an inhospitable place at best
Sire, not a land that I would choose to farm or live on."</p>
<p class="western">"The ground we followed turned out to be a
spit or ridge running between the two valleys, the ground dropped
away occasionally then suddenly rose again, creating a rock
fortress or buttress, which looked out over the open space, where
both joined. We lay concealed by the scrub looking at a massive
assembly point over which was spread another army of
Nailstead."</p>
<p class="western">"I had though that I had encountered
Nailstead's main armies already, not once, but twice! Now I knew
that what I had seen was only a portion of the massive amount of
fighters he had at his disposal. Before me was a gathering point
for those forces. The valley troops would slowly filter down into
that massive plain, as would the other encampments; forming up,
arming themselves out of the stream of wagons we had tracked, and
then they would head out to do battle with our people."</p>
<p class="western">"The amount and pure aggressiveness shown out
there on that plain stood me in awe of the battle to come. Never
has such a massive army been assembled in one place, and it was
still growing I realised! There were the other troops we had
encounter still to arrive! The tent cities I had seen earlier and
of course Nailstead himself."</p>
<p class="western">"Such a shame I found myself thinking, that
my arrow had been detected by him and deflected by him, it could
have ended the threat to our world at one single stroke, but that
was in the past, and now I or should I say we sire have to face the
reality of the coming future. I was trapped, out there waits a
formidable enemy, and I have nowhere left to go but back. My only
options being to return and attempt to cross the track-way or enter
out into that plain with its massed army. Neither option held much
of an appeal but certainly I realised that entering that plain down
there would be nothing short of suicide."</p>
<p class="western">"With a last look out over the ground I
realised just how close to my home and safety I was, perhaps, only
a mile or two beyond that army, waited a valley, which led directly
to the black road and from there to my home. They, our enemies were
massing below us, intending a concerted push out and over the black
road that became obvious, the only problem I had was how to return
to you Sire with my warning and details of Nailstead's plan."</p>
<p class="western">"I turned around, my decision forced upon me,
the wolf turned, he to having realised that we could travel no
further by our intended route. We climbed down from our vantage
point reaching the bottom dip of the ridge faster than we had
reached the top, which was when I heard the first warning beat of a
drum. It boomed out across the plain indicating the imminent
arrival of one of the most feared fighting forces under Nailstead's
control; Rock Trolls! Wolf plunged off to my right, I followed
quickly seeking cover and to catch him up, he entered into a dense
patch of grasses of uncertain heritage and stopped, looking out,
sniffing in long snorts of air, scenting the creatures approaching
and growling low. He sensed the danger that the drums indicated to
me."</p>
<p class="western">"I put my hand on his neck feeling his course
fur rising, his neck muscles tensed as his anger became clear to
me. We waited, uncertainty filled my mind, rock trolls are deadly,
virtually unstoppable in battle, fearless, because little threatens
them, their only real weakness is a total absence of intelligence,
they can be killed, but it is never easy to achieve. How many of
them I wondered, knowing that I would have to wait, to watch, if I
was to learn."</p>
<p class="western">"I could not leave without knowing the
strength of these creatures; an army of them could easily wipe out
any resistance and where rock trolls were concerned, an army is two
dozen or so! The boom of their drum approached steadily. Creatures
turned aware of the arrivals, scared of them; even the darkest of
Nailstead's determined force would shun the presence of rock
trolls. We waited together, wolf and I, each comforted by the
presence of the other, each watching for the arrivals, each hoping
to live and transmit our discoveries to you Sire."</p>
<p class="western">"They arrived, they marched in two's, side by
side, evenly pacing, evenly plodding forward, evenly shaking the
ground as the unison of their step thudded down. Hundreds of tonnes
of rock muscle, all driven by a tiny brain! You could cut the head
of a rock troll and it would be an hour before the body realised
that it was dead! We watched together, I do not know about the wolf
but I had forgotten to breathe."</p>
<p class="western">"The lead pair set the pace, rock trolls are
not fast but they just keep going. The drum was being beaten by the
nearest troll to us; the flag of allegiance to Nailstead was
carried by his companion marching beside him. They are all male I
knew, there are very few female rock trolls, and I am very glad of
the fact. Legend says that the females are far more ferocious than
the males! A male, it is said, faces death with every contact he
has with a female, a fact that restricts the birth rate of them
thankfully".</p>
<p class="western">"They marched on following the winding road
towards the plain, I wondered if they would ever halt, camp and
wait, or had they been given other instructions to follow? Too my
horror the rock trolls performed a perfect left wheel and now faced
directly towards the lowest point of the ridge, ignoring the
encampment out on the plain before them. They marched in
exhaustibly on, directly towards where the wolf and I were watching
their progress from."</p>
