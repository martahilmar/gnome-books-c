<p class="western">Vindec felt the pull within his mind, felt
the drawing of his thoughts; from far away in the cavern in which
his physical entity stood, the stone called to him. Slowly without
control Vindec turned around, drawn by the pull, responding to the
stone, hearing the witch. Had any of the dark lord's marching army
been able to see the standing entity that was Vindec, they would
have seen that his presence dimmed. He faded slightly as his spirit
was drawn away from the abyss, which reared skywards behind him,
open and accepting, ready and able to accept the columns of
marching creatures into itself, its destiny for them all decreed by
ancient magic.</p>
<p class="western">High in the sky a black dot floated away from
him, Vindec closed with it, being drawn away from the abyss and
towards the flying creature, his spirit faded to nothing, leaving
behind only a rock circle, alone and untenanted, its duty
completed. The symbols at its center faded, the outer line
disappeared, and finally the writing vanished, becoming once more
quartz patterning in the rock surface.</p>
<p class="western">The air thickened as Vindec flew, his mind
floating towards a reunification with his body; the witch warned
him, he looked right, seeing the hunched forward figure, with its
cowl flapping in the head on wind, as mighty wings beat at the air.
Vindec felt himself passing the creature and its rider; he felt the
evil intent surrounding the figure and understood who, and what it
was. Soon he entered into the light of the Lifestone, seconds
passed, an eternity of waiting, but still only seconds, as his
shade returned into its host body once more. Vindec awoke, his eyes
opened, his arms ached, he lowered them to his side; he felt
exhaustion swamping him, drawing his will to resist, creating fear
of the battle he knew was fast approaching.</p>
<p class="western">The light expanded brightening the cavern, it
filled every nook and cranny of its rock containment, the crystal
lived and it intended to go on living. The witch reached out to the
barely standing magician, her touch ethereal, but the effect it had
on Vindec was solid, revitalizing, filling him with power, forcing
his weakened body to comply with her will. Vindec looked up as the
light in the cavern returned to a more comfortable level for one
such as he.</p>
<p class="western">Out there, his mind felt the presence of the
approaching creature, soon it would no longer be only felt, soon it
would be seen. Soon there would be a battle of powerful magic's,
Vindec was ready, he had doubts, he worried, but the stone spoke to
him, the stone reassured him, the stone would support him as it had
supported him out on the plain, as he had stood before the abyss
that he had opened.</p>
<p class="western">The stone is my source of power, the stone is
the life and entity of the planet, the stone will have its way. The
voice in his head repeated the litany, driving confidence into
Vindec the magician, formally Vindec the water carrier.</p>
<p class="western">"Soon it soothed him, soon all will be as it
is written, soon, you will see and understand, soon!"</p>
<p class="western">The voice faded from his mind, shattered by
the ungodly screech of a demon, riding a creature of the dark
night; Nailstead had arrived. The battle was joined the enemies
faced each other.</p>
<p class="western">Life now teetered on the brink of
annihilation, coming was the first battle of good verses evil, the
outcome would save or destroy this world. The outcome was
unwritten, the legends told only up to the point of joining and no
further, the battle was joined.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Vindec turned from the stone, to face the
balcony, the same balcony out of which the witch had first shown
him the world. The place where she had demanded of the young water
carrier his total loyalty to her, and his hard work given freely,
promising him a future with her beyond his imagination. He had
accepted the challenge she had laid at his feet, and now he stood
facing the balcony once more, no longer a boy, no longer weak. He
felt ready to meet the challenge to come, and the stone made his
confidence in both it and himself soar.</p>
<p class="western">Tainted air thrust through the open balcony
to swirl around the cavern, driven by the back draft creating by
the down beats of the dragon's wings as it slowed. Clawed feet
reached out as huge wings folded, the beast had landed, the dark
lord had arrived to claim his destiny. Vindec was the only barrier
remaining to the power the dark one desires, Vindec the boy of
legend, the witches confident. Vindec lifted his right arm, his
fingers extending, preparing for the battle to come, within his
chest his confidence grew as his power expanded, filling him.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Reacting on instinct the dwarf began to turn,
automatically his hand sought out the pommel of his weapon, even
more automatically, his eyes scanned the ground before him. Next to
the King stood the wolf, scenting the air and seeing the dwarf,
with a gentle lope the wolf closed on the dwarf, the wolf was half
way towards his weapon drawing friend, half way, away from
Iffilditch and the King. His approach caused the dwarf to look back
glancing away from the battlefield, only for a split second, but it
was long enough for the figure standing between the collapsed rock
trolls to react.</p>
<p class="western">He, the spider man charged forward, his black
dagger extended before him, his long gangling legs carried him
along the solid surface of the black road. He could see his target
sitting beneath the tree, resting on the stone lintel. Something
pushed at his back increasing his speed, the spider man
accelerated, closing fast his destiny awaited him he knew and
understood. The dwarf watched; the wolf saw, it halted glanced
across, it saw the lunging figure and recognised both it and also
the threat its presence indicated to the King's life.</p>
<p class="western">Dwarf fingers released the half drawn blade;
it would do no good in this situation. He reached up and around,
grasping at his bow, yanking it over his head, spinning it ready
for use. His other hand reached for an arrow, drawing it across the
bow stock, knocking it to the string, pulling back, twisting and
raising the loaded weapon, seeking out his target all in one smooth
fast practiced series of movements.</p>
<p class="western">The spider man had covered the distance in
half the time he would have expected, he was to close to the King
for the dwarf to fire, the dwarf was good with a bow (nothing like
as good as an Elf would be, but still good) but still he hesitated,
he feared that he might hit the King. The risk was too great; he
threw the weapon to the floor whilst screaming out a warning to
Iffilditch, frantically he pointed at the fast closing threat. The
elf turned, first to face him, trying to understand. A wind sprung
up separating them, a dark wind filled with evil and intent; it
shattered the dwarf's words into loosely scattered syllables. The
pointing hand meant little alone; it could even be mistaken for a
gesture of welcome, a greeting of sorts.</p>
<p class="western">The wolf halted, not because of the dwarves
panic, but because a strange and threatening scent accosted his
nostrils. The creature turned, it detected the spider man, saw him
running; with instincts born in the wild the wolf turned, pivoting
and launched itself into full muscle driven attack. The spider man
ran hard, he lowered his shoulder to catch the half turning
Iffilditch below the breast, he heaved him away from the slowly
rising King.</p>
<p class="western">The blade extended further reaching out to
its target as the King reached for his sword. The wolf leapt
lunging with his teeth fully bared, at the interloper. The King
leant back trying to avoid the confrontation or to gain some space
to maneuver. Realising that the wolf would get to him before he
could complete his masters mission, the spider man threw his blade.
It spun through the air as the wolf's teeth clamped deeply into his
arm refusing to let go. The leap of the wolf allowed his momentum
to continue to carrying him over the spider man's body, he pulled
him with him, spinning them both into the dust and away from the
King.</p>
<p class="western">Iffilditch regained his feet, his weapon
drawn, searching he saw the sunlight sparkle on the black dull
blade as it flew true. The King watched as the spinning blade
approached him, still confused, still feeling the fear and self
doubt that had accosted him, not even now realising that he was
under deadly attack by a minion of the dark one. That it had been
Nailstead that had created the deep felt confusion in him or that
he had sent out his mind mists to ensnare the King and slow him
down. The blade spun again, rotating across the separating
distance, looking almost as though it might miss the King. Snarls
filled the air; dwarf feet pounded the ground in a desperate surge
towards the King.</p>
<p class="western">The wolf held on, the spider man fought back,
then without any reason he stopped his resistance, and with his
duty done to the dark lord the dark magic vanished from his mind
and body leaving him exhausted, he just lay back as though he was
relaxing. The wolf expected further resistance and when there was
none, the creature lets go, backing away from the dust covered
human, continually growling deep in his throat, the enemy had
confused him completely. The blade spun out one last rotation as it
cut through the air; the King reacted at last, by levering himself
up and away from the tree stump against which he had fallen. The
tumbling blade would miss his body; the King bent forward, he
twisted hard, levering his body, he used his arm against the tree,
to push away, trying to catapult himself out of the path of
harm.</p>
<p class="western">The blade struck the tree, burying its self
two inches into the soft wood. A single scream of pain rent the
air; Iffilditch looked across, seeing the King, his left hand
clamped tight by his right hand. Iffilditch saw the blade, still
vibrating in the wood, he saw the spider man now lying back at
rest. The dwarf arrived at last panting hard; he stretched out to
his King with one hand, whilst tearing at his tunic, to rip a thin
strip of cloth free with his other, reaching out now for the King's
wounded hand. The black blade had passed between the thumb and
finger, its point piercing through the thin flap of skin, before
burying itself into the wood of the tree, its job complete.</p>
<p class="western">The King had yanked his hand free tearing his
skin, leaving a flap which was now bleeding profusely. A minor
wound he realised but also a painful wound, flashed through the
dwarves brain, followed by a heart felt, thank the god's! The wolf
looked up, growling once as the spider man slowly sat up, he looked
across at the dwarf and then to the King. They both looked back.
Something happened, something they would never have believed
possible if they hadn't watched it happen.</p>
<p class="western">Spider man looked down at his arms, confusion
and terror flooding his face, a burgeoning horror thrust into him,
created by what he saw. His arms shimmered, his legs flared as
though on fire, his body lit up and finally his face glowed bright,
all contained as though within a raging fire. His screams tore at
the watchers minds; they stand by each of them feeling helpless
whilst they watched the glowing figure change. The arms shortened
slightly, thickening, at the sametime the humans deformed legs did
like wise. His head was the most horrifying for them to watch, it
seemed to swell as tissue flowed like oil on water, changing
position, driven from his bones which shortly, like the skin
covering them, liquefied and then also flowed. He was changing
shape before them all, the flesh fluidity settled resuming a new
form, it resets into someone human looking, but different.</p>
<p class="western">Slowly the body altered added more to the
humanity of the spider man. Even more slowly the King began to
recognise the figure forming infront of him. All still had weapons
drawn and ready; all were unable to use them so addictive was the
transmogrification that happened before them. The figure fell back
to the ground it thrashed in burning agony. Bones crunched then
reset, the body fell silent, the head still thrashed despite the
screams having ended; slowly the glow faded, revealing a body to
them, a human body, a very familiar human body.</p>
<p class="western">The Kings First Knight lay in the dust before
them; his armour tainted a dirty brown by the sod and dust. The
knight breathed slowly, but evenly; the spider man was gone; in his
place lay the body of Sir Lancelot, the King's Champion, friend and
also the lost scout. The dwarf looked down, not understanding; the
King looked down saddened, a tear forming in his eye. Lancelot had
been the third scout he had dispatched out into no mans land,
instructed like the dwarf and Iffilditch to hunt out the truth of
Nailstead's armies. Now all three of the King's scouts were back,
and all were alive. Though what had happened to the knight was
still incomprehensible to the King.</p>
<p class="western">The dwarf looked down at the knight; he heard
the screams of a dying man echoing through his memory. He had been
certain that it had been the missing King's scout that he had
failed to save. Now he knew that it was not the scout, he felt
relief for his King. Loosing a friend in the way the dwarf had
described the human's death was no easy matter. Loosing that friend
because you had dispatched them about a mission, created a feeling
of deep guilt, a massive, almost unbearable amount of guilt. That
guilt was at least was removed from the King's mind, by the return
of his friend and missing scout.</p>
<p class="western">All that remained though was the puzzle, who
then was it that I heard dying in such agony, thought the Dwarf? He
accepted there and then that he might never find out, but then
again he reasoned, once the battle was won and the dark forces had
been banished or destroyed, perhaps I will return to that
encampment and see for myself a simple thought which became a
promise on which to act..</p>
<p class="western">Colour returned to the King's cheeks; he
stood a little taller, more upright, more regal looking, he knelt
now, bending to one knee by the fallen knight his lost friend. The
knight looked up, met his King's eyes, and smiled; it lit up his
face, changed his countenance and lightened the atmosphere. The
King approached closer leaning in slightly to the knight,
Iffilditch reached out intending to stop the royal egress, this
knight was the same creature that minutes before had attempted to
kill his King. The King approached him, bare-chested and
vulnerable, it seemed wrong to Iffilditch. The dwarf stepped
closer, he also looked down at the knight, who in response shifted
slightly under their intense study, he propped his torso up with
his arms trying to look more personable and he smiled heartily with
the light of recognition burning brightly in his eyes.</p>
<p class="western">"Lancelot old friend it is good to see you
safe and well!" The King's voice sounded croaky, as though he was
having difficulty forming his words. Water thought the dwarf,
reaching down to pluck his carrier from his waist then holding it
out to the King, who drank and looked better for the fluid, he in
his turn offered the flask to the sitting knight. Iffilditch, still
wary, watched for treachery, but detected nothing but genuine
affection.</p>
<p class="western">"Sire," the knight looked around him for the
first time, seeing the gathered army, seeing the wolf that had
bitten him, seeing the concern in the eyes of his King. He tried to
stand, only to be waved down by the King.</p>
<p class="western">"Where am I?" He looked around again, this
time recognizing exactly where he was, the tree that formed a cross
stood beyond the bending King. The black road into the mountains
stretched away behind him. He changed his question to. "How did I
get here?"</p>
<p class="western">"Later old friend, later!" Exclaimed the much
relived King as he glanced towards his dwarf and elf companions, a
smile flitting across his face.</p>
<p class="western">"You three are returned and that is how it
should be!" His smile of relief turned into a grin of pleasure.
Even Iffilditch relaxed slightly, but he still kept a wary eye on
the once assailant.</p>
<p class="western">The wolf closed causing the knight to turn
his head sharply, it sniffed at the air, scenting the fallen
knight, detecting nothing of the scent of the man creature it had
so recently attacked. Satisfied the wolf walked around the group
circling until it stood by the side of the dwarf, it nudged at his
short legs seeking reassurance form him, the dwarf's hand descended
to pat and then ruffle the shaggy head.</p>
<p class="western">If the wolf is unconcerned reasoned
Iffilditch, then there should be nothing now for me to be concerned
over either. The wolf would know an enemy, it always did and
Iffilditch had learnt to trust the creatures instincts during their
travels together. He relaxed; the only outward sign of him relaxing
was that his right palm moved away from the pommel of his families'
sword. The dwarf noted the slight movement, as did the knight; he
was relived but confused at why the Elf might be suspicious of
him.</p>
<p class="western">"Can you stand?" The dwarf asked, reaching
down to offer his hand to the knight, who reached up, accepting his
offer. The King grasped the knights other arm and between them they
helped him over to the stone plinth which surrounded the ancient
tree. Iffilditch held his breath, doubt flooded his mind again but
it was a misleading doubt, one best ignored and not spoken of.</p>
<p class="western">More water and a comfortable place to sit
improved the knight tremendously. The dwarf turned his attention
back to his injured King; the bleeding had stopped, the bandage
pressure having done its work, still the dwarf reached out wanting
to take a closer look at the injury. The knight looked on; above
his head and sticking out of the tree was the blade that had so
nearly killed the King. He saw it and shuddered, an image of it
flying towards his lord, to briefly pin the King's hand to the tree
trunk flickered distantly in his thoughts. His mind was clouded and
smoke hidden he could remember nothing but pain and suffering, and
a dark voice that seemed to drift in the smoke wanting something
from him.</p>
<p class="western">Above the blade, the trees twin branches
reached out one to either side, ancient bare boughs pointed to the
right and left as though acting as a barrier, like a man standing
arms outstretched refusing to let anyone to pass. The tree even had
a head, well in a twisted sort of way, it looked much like a head,
being a growth of two feet or so of the trunk swathed in long
thorns. The knight had never noticed before how much the lightening
strikes against the tree had blackened the tip of the protrusion,
killing the wood above the out reaching arms. To him it looked as
though the tree had hair, just another thing about this ancient
tree that made it look a little like a man, one attempting to stop
a passing or perhaps an invasion.</p>
<p class="western">His eyes fell again tracing the rough bark
down to the blade, he shuddered again, as his mind began to exert
itself, his memory returned slightly, he saw himself and the blade
and the King infront of him, horror at what he had so nearly done
bubbled up, threatening to drown him in anguish, he looked up
fearing the worst.</p>
<p class="western">The King saw his reaction; he understood it
somehow and reached out a friendly hand, placing it reassuringly on
his oldest human friends shoulder.</p>
<p class="western">"That is the past Lancelot, it is best
forgotten, my friend."</p>
<p class="western">The King was as always being a true friend to
Lancelot just as he had always been, and both knew it. Either would
die for the other if necessary, the bond and trust existed between
them and it extended from the King to encompass the Elf and the
Dwarf, and now it even included the Wolf. Four friends standing
together, gathered before a field of battle, sharing their
bond.</p>
<p class="western">All around the four friends voices called to
one another, first in whispers of disbelief, then as the situation
developed, the voices grew until all around the four friends the
cheers of a relived army exploded into the air, the four looked up
and across at the troops. They were standing; out of their
protective pits, waving their weapons in the air, backs got
slapped, friends hugged one another, excitement filled the day,
flooded out, around and across the plain, beating at the backs of
the deformed creatures standing. No turning, the King realised, not
standing! Turning away from his army, facing toward the distant
mountains, withdrawing, Nailstead's army had begun to move.</p>
<p class="western">Those that could run did so, charging away
from the battle ground their lord and master had chosen, all
interest in fighting gone from their minds. Blighted creatures
flew; the King looked up just in time to see the final vestiges of
Nailstead's airborne troops vanishing over the distant mountains.
His own flighted warriors circled in the sky, the armies cheering
reached up to them, and they like the army below joined in with it.
Excitement filled the breast of every soldier, thousands of lives
had been spared that day by the enemies about face, and out on the
field, the King and his friends, like his army, could see the
creatures depart. They Slithered, walked, stomped, and some dragged
themselves away; they all one way or another departed back towards
the valley entrance that had disgorged them out onto this plain of
battle.</p>
<p class="western">The King turned away from the battlefield his
attention drawn upward and distant. The witch had done what she had
said that she would do. The war was over; the people, his people
were safe, the threat removed or so he and they believed</p>
<p class="western">The day had been won, the King heard,
heralded loudly by a young soldier standing on a distant stone
wall, his weapons tilted towards the floor, his manner relaxed and
happy. Again he shouted for all to hear and understand.</p>
<p class="western">"The day is ours, long live the King!"</p>
<p class="western">The uproar grew as others joined in the
rallying call, a thousand, no two thousand voices shouted out,
screaming joyously to the world.</p>
<p class="western">"Long live the King, the day is ours, long
live the King!" Again and again, until most of the King's army were
incapable of shouting any more; then the air fell silent, the sound
died, and the King realised that it was his turn to say something
to them all and they were waiting intently.</p>
