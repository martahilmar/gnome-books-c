<p class="western">Arthur studied the ground as beyond the
distant mountains the sun slowly protruded, hesitant at first to
cast its daily light, but quickly growing in confidence and
illumination. Directly infront of him and a hundred yards away
there ended a very wide black strip known as the evil road, or more
commonly to his people as the devils pathway or black road. Arthur
looked along the strip; it ran straight as an arrow flies into the
heart of the mountains. It had been along this road that as a young
boy he had wandered.</p>
<p class="western">Now he was facing it again, but this time he
was looking for the first sign of an enemy. High in the sky dark
clouds had formed, seeming to rise from the teeth of distant jagged
rock, they were swirling around and around with hidden purpose. The
cloud was not harmless mist and water; it was made of living
tissue, it was a cloud of thousands of flighted creatures. Each of
the constituents of the cloud were circling to gain height, before
charging as a hoard over the pathway towards his waiting troops.
That cloud was the first sign that battle was commencing, that
death would shortly come to many.</p>
<p class="western">Behind him and to his sides his troops
waited, all loyal, all desperate to win, prepared for the onslaught
their weapons clutched tight ready for use. His eyes detected a
blackness at the mountains foot where the road disappeared from
view. The blackness closed, becoming clearer, troops mounted on
carts pulled by long necked flightless creatures, which he knew
could breathe fire, charged towards his positions. Pike-men surged
around the King's position digging there long pointed poles into
the hard ground. Archers took up position behind the wooden
barricades. Behind him, the once boy, now King, knew his mounted
troops were gathering for the first of many charges. Death blows
would soon be exchanged, the outcome of which was uncertain and the
end a long hard fight away. He watched and waited his preparations
made; it was too late to alter anything life or death was at
hand.</p>
<p class="western">The battle would soon be engaged, the forces
in opposition met and then a win or a defeat would be in the hands
of the Gods. He had devised his strategy knowing that his enemy
would chose to move the bulk of its forces along the black road
that led from the mountains. He looked along the roadway seeing
only a river of dark hardness, down which he had walked so many
years before. Now carriages filled with hordes of dark creatures
threatened to charge along it, too obliterate all the gently people
of his world. They would destroy all that he believed in, crushing
the fine arts, destroying and pillaging, clashing and killing, in a
slaughter unprecedented as they swarmed outwards and into the
distant vulnerable lands beyond. It was up to him and of course the
hardy fighters behind and to his sides, to quell this evil force;
he hoped to destroy it in its entirety bringing an end to the
nightmare that had existed for to long.</p>
<p class="western">Arthur looked into the rising sun seeking out
a familiar shape, Nailstead the enemy of life, Nailstead his
boy-hood friend, Nailstead the deposed, was not in sight. High
above his position the dark clouds dispersed into columns of
flighted creatures, each mounted by an evil force. They burst out
of the rising sun intent on reaping their master's revenge. Behind
Arthur was a range of low hills, on the top of those hills stood a
thin line of people, they were the magi, 'the holy ones', the
wielders of arcane powers, they were the first line of his defense
against the use of magic or conjuration. They could also be
offensive in nature and now they banded close together, a huddle of
decisive power ready to be unleashed at his command.</p>
<p class="western">One stepped forwards as the boy now King
watched. He raised a glistening staff and fire burst upwards into
normal cloud above them. The cloud reacted instantly, splitting and
spreading, covering the grounded defenders. Lightening spewed from
its heart striking into the evil creatures. Some was deflected
towards the ground, but the mass of power exploded, dissolving the
first and nearest of Nailstead's troops, battle was sought battle
was commenced the first blow had been struck. Now only the will of
the people could direct the outcome of this engagement. High above
Arthur's head, the flight of enemies pealed apart. Much like a
rotting corpse dragged by a horse might be rent into pieces. Wings
beat at tainted air, vainly trying to avoid the searing destruction
of light that had been unleashed amidst their flock. From behind
mounted soldiers flew high above his head, circling, trying to gain
the commanding battle position of height. In front of Arthur the
first line of archers were readying their bows, long shafts with
heavy weighted talon like barbs tilted upwards in readiness of the
order being given to let fly.</p>
<p class="western">With simultaneous release the arrows scorched
into the sky arching through the lightening streaks with out
damage, to plunge into the creatures of the cloud. Two barrages of
wood and steel followed; devastating the first wave of Nailstead's
forces. With the last of the arrows fired, the mounted forces
circling high above descended in a speed gathering charge, which
cut a swath through the blooded creatures. Those that were
fortunate enough to survive turned with their cargoes and retreated
towards the mountain pass.</p>
<p class="western">They flew over their own forces as they
marched along the black road seeking out their enemy. Arthur
watched the army, the closer it moved the more troops there seemed
to be, his scouts were flying high above them counting their
numbers, soon they would be back and he would know exactly how
unbalanced this battle was going to be. Soon he would know if the
threat posed was resistible with any hope of victory waiting
un-seen, waiting to be snatched from defeat.</p>
<p class="western">Giant wings beat the air above him; his twin
guard's, their weapons drawn back, took aim at the approaching
bird. Their fingers tightly gripped the stretched gut cord of their
short bows. Slowly as recognition dawned they eased back their
taught arms, not lowering their weapons, but also not preparing to
fire. The bird's wings easily stretched out twenty feet on a side;
one beat of those colossuses was enough to slow the creature, a
final flap and ten inch long talons grasped the three foot thick
wall, using it as a handy perch. On the back of the giant Eagle Owl
rode a creature, a creature that was part man, part elf and perhaps
part something else that was entirely different. The male looking
creature leapt from its saddle and approached the eagerly waiting
King. Bowing smartly from the waist it presented a scroll, Arthur
un-rolled the hide cover, to reveal the papyrus enclosed. He
examined it eagerly, as though his life depended on it, which as
deep thought decreed, he realized that it might well.</p>
<p class="western">Drawn in neat detailed images were the
outlines and formations of his enemy. Magic had fueled the scroll;
all that the giant owl had needed to do was fly. Owls were not at
their best in harsh daylight, but in this case for this mission the
bird had been fitted with custom made dark glasses. Its mounted
Halfling had acted as extra eyes and provided aerial defense. Bow
drawn the creature had sat astride the owls back, gripping tight
with its legs whilst firing arrows at any creature that had
attempted to interfere with its passing. There was no archer more
feared than a Halfling going about its business, and no flighted
creature could match the grace or power of an owl in flight, let
alone fight mode.</p>
<p class="western">Together this pair had penetrated deep over
the dark forces ranged against him, and returned unscathed from
their effort, and with a map of the enemy's dispositions. The
battle it would seem was to be a straightforward, no subtleties, a
full frontal attack, utilizing the black road as a fast access
route. Nailstead would have a few surprises up his cowled sleeves
Arthur was sure, but then again so had he. He dispatched the
Halfling to the south with a detailed plan now drawn on one half of
the papyrus sheet. He then summoned a runner to his side, and
dispatched him to the North, taking with him the other half of the
sheet. His defenses finally placed the King prepared to draw his
final weapon, his loyal troops in defense of his realm.</p>
<p class="western">Â <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">Beneath the aerial assault Nailstead's stream
of troops halted, fanning out to left and right into and across the
dust bowl of the plains. They formed up into ranks and then tight
grouped boxes of fighting evil, intent on marching as one towards
the King's position, and swamping it by weight of numbers alone.
The boxes moved slowly with deliberate strides, controlled by the
beat of an invisible drum. Creatures huddled together, shields of
wood and metal held out infront of them, above them and also to
their rear, creating an armoured, impenetrable, single fighting
entity of each grouping of creatures.</p>
<p class="western">Though not swift in locomotion, the creatures
moved inexorably forwards, closing with the waiting force of the
King. Lines formed, as creatures settled into slow marching ground
covering trains of armour, more creatures formed up behind the
first ranks, adding to the potential for bloody devastation. Line
upon line of the monstrous combined creatures closed, marching
across the dust plain.</p>
<p class="western">Still the King stood brave and dominant a top
of the wall, watching carefully the approaching hoards. He raised
one finger slightly; to his right a runner departed heading towards
the approaching wave of living machines, he raised another finger
on the other hand and to his left a runner ran, also heading out
into the plain. Both runners arrived at their individual
destinations, throwing themselves into deep, well concealed holes;
joining with the pair of humans waiting for their arrival. The
signal had been given, now all that was required of the waiting
watchers was to enact their instructions.</p>
<p class="western">Turning as one to face forwards one of the
twin humans gathered together the flexible strands which protruded
from a single black tube, which extruded out of the soil infront of
him. The second human picked up a tapering fuse and lit it from a
steel flint grinder, sparking the taper to life. It flamed and
settled eager to light and burn anything around it. The human
applied it to the tightly gathered bundle of flexible fuses held by
his companion, they both watched, they lit their oil soaked fibers
grasping and welcoming the flame eagerly, the fires were alight,
now nothing could stop them as they burned.</p>
<p class="western">Their duty done the figures scrambled from
their pits eager to run for safety, but each was magnetically drawn
to turn around and face the oncoming enemy. The runner watched from
behind one of the humans, as an arrow fell from the sky piercing
the fragile human frame with a long devastating shaft, more spear
like than arrow. It protruded through the male body sticking into
the hard ground, holding the victim erect and facing towards the on
coming enemy with a look of unexpected death plastered across his
face the soon to be corpse waited.</p>
<p class="western">Death was certain for the victim but still
elusive, he watched, pinned as he was, breathing hard because of
the wood shaft passing through his body. Blood bubbled from between
his lips as he tried to tell his companions to leave. It was too
late; they joined him, transfixed to the spot, pinned like moths on
a collection board, each facing forwards, each watching as the
nemesis of all human and elf alike slowly approached. All three
died before the crawling machines of evil entities passed over
them, crushing their bodies beneath booted or clawed feet failing
to halt their march or care about the lives so recently taken that
were crushed beneath them, joining and adding to the dust.</p>
<p class="western">Below them hidden from sight beneath the dust
the fuses burned, each spreading out, fan like, linking up,
lighting others, forming a wheel beneath the ground encircling the
marching invaders, undermining their prospects. The King watched
and waited counting down the minutes, then the seconds before full
engagement occurred. The first ranks had reached his troops, who
exactly as planned retreated, making a great show of their apparent
cowardice, thus encouraging the enemy to march more confidently
forward.</p>
<p class="western">'Ten'. He turned from the slowly approaching
enemy, watching his troops rush past his position and settle
themselves into pre-prepared trenches or taking cover behind walls,
all aspect of their apparent previous cowardice having vanished.
'Four'. He raised both arms above his head and counted silently.
'Two, One. Zero finally arrived and his arms dropped, behind his
unflinching back the earth exploded in sheets of fire, gouts of
soil burst into the air shattering the creatures trapped on the
plain. Smoke billowed as more explosions occurred, each accompanied
by its own walls of flame which then flowed across the dry hard
ground, linking up, whilst cremating the King's enemies from the
ground up. Flames crawled up the legs of the still marching evil,
swallowing their flesh, destroying any remaining will to fight,
shattering Nailstead's army into pathetic screaming groups of
partially cremated creatures. Beyond the king the approaching army
burned in a living fire from hell, all encompassed were desperate
now to escape the terror and torment of the encroaching flames and
the death they wrought.</p>
<p class="western">Death came slowly to those not instantly
shattered by the explosions, The flames continued to link and
expand reaching high into the clear sky. Fire flooding the clean
air with the effluvial muck of the dying, soil encompassed
creatures, their spirits burnt away and carried by the gently
winds. Behind them held in reserve at the base of the mountains
waited a large moving swarm of minions loyal to the Dark One, they
began to spread like spilled ink across the plain as the King and
his troops watched in awe at their numbers.</p>
<p class="western">Their first assault had been broken, nay
shattered to pieces, the flighted beasts had been driven from the
skies but still Nailstead had more, much more to call on for his
assault. He spread his army out in readiness of the charge, which
should or so he believed carry his forces over the resisting
Human's and Elves, defeating and burying them beneath beak and
claw. Destruction of his enemies was his only concern, total
annihilation his only current goal, even power took second place to
his main aim of destruction. His army multiplied, closing because
of the necessity of closing, to allow more and varied forces access
to the battlefield behind the leading troops. Slowly the numbers
increased as did the self belief in each of them, they marched
confidently forward the fire before them dying away.</p>
<p class="western">The King stood his ground watching the
mounting force; his plan held as did the bravery of his troops,
there were more surprises in store for this force before the day
was to be over. Again he wondered if there was no other way, no
hope of peace with his old compatriot and childhood friend, again
he had to accept that peace was an impossibility now only battle
and death remained for one of them.</p>
<p class="western">He had sent an emissary with greetings to
meet with Nailstead; a trusted emissary, a friend; infact the man
that had brought him to the place that he now occupied. Nailstead
had betrayed that emissary who had also once been his friend,
killing him slowly, roasting and pealing his flesh from his old
bones. That was before sending a detailed account of his death, all
neatly inked on the inside of the dead mans own skin back to the
King along with what remained of the desecrated body.</p>
<p class="western">There could be no peace between them, only
death and destruction could be the outcome of this day, death to
whom, remained to be seen, but death breathed near to all on that
plain, defender and attacker alike. Death held no interest in whom
it claimed, only that it claimed any that were available, death
would be the main reveler this evening.</p>
<p class="western">The death fires faded away, spluttered, and
then finally they went out, leaving pillars of black evil smelling
smoke to roil upwards, carrying the burnt signatures of the
deceased. Though out there were mostly creatures of the dark, now,
spawn of evil intentions, still they had each and everyone of them
once been creatures like he. They had lived their lives in and
around the lands that he now ruled; they had been citizens prior to
responding to the Dark One's call. They had once had families; some
still had families, though they were by their own choice lost to
them forever, a forgotten life.</p>
<p class="western">Others were alone through choice, disaffected
youth turned to black evil creature in the blink of a magical eye.
Acceptance of the Dark One's aims destroyed the little remaining
essence of humanity that had been creations gift to them, now
mounting and expanding they filled the distant horizon. Bent on the
annihilation and mutilation of the innocent, the people they blamed
for their condition, the innocent people who carried no blame for
their own decisions.</p>
<p class="western">Only the Dark Lord Nailstead, my friend once,
now become my enemy had any right to shoulder the blame that is
stifling out on the plain. I will face them all, despite being
outnumbered, I will never accept even the possibility of defeat.
The dark army is on the march! Churning the dry soil they trample
over into thick clouds of dust, camouflaging their image but
equally demarking their position. Behind them and concealed from
the King's sight less the Magi or worse the witch locate him,
waited Nailstead, clear in intent and favoring utter destruction.
He unleashed his second wave of minions, not soldiers as I command,
but minions. Creatures without thought, their only to obey and die,
existing now only to fulfill his dark desires, more to be pitied
for their lost humanity, but deadly no less for its loss.</p>
