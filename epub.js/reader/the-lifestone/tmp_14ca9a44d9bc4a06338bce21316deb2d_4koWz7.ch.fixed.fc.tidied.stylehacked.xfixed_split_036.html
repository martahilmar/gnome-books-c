<p class="western">Vindec led the King and his knights between
the twin statuary guardians, they which had once been the deadliest
of human enemies. He had spent much time before the crystal segment
of the Lifestone communing seeking permission and acceptance for
one last venture into the Olar he had crafted to protect the
Lifestone throughout eternity. Finally the Lifestone had granted
his most dear wish, he would be allowed to lead the King and his
knights to their resting place.</p>
<p class="western">He guided his donkey pulled cart through the
fast growing maze of trees and dense underbrush. The land around
him had and was changing, it was becoming a living entity, always
moving, constant yet different. Had he not known the exact
placement of the castle then he would have been lost. The wolf
moved up next to the magician matching the donkeys and man's pace
perfectly, an occasional low growl could be heard from him as they
penetrated deeper into the Olar, the changeling marsh protector of
the Lifestone created by Vindec and the children.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec looked down reaching out to place a
calming hand on the creature's fur. The wolf like the land about it
had changed. He was much larger, far more alert, and gave off a
distinct feeling of understanding everything about him. How or why,
Vindec had no idea, but the truth of the change moved closer to his
side, lifting its shaggy head towards Vindec's descending hand, a
return of the greeting that the magician had intended to bestow. It
was not the wolf that was calmed by the contact as expected by
Vindec, it was the magician. Much has changed in the Olar!</p>
<p class="western">Vindec pulled against the tether of the
donkey, halting it before the entry to the great hall. Behind him
the King also halted, dismounting. Behind the King the ninety-nine
knights did like wise, accompanied by the metallic clanking of
armour plates being moved by flesh. All stood as one in silence,
looking at Vindec, waiting. He stepped forward, the twin doors
opened to greet his and their arrival.</p>
<p class="western">On the back of the wagon had been placed one
hundred preformed metal rods, each with a prong of steel fitted at
one end, round and grooved for a tight fit into a receptive ring
slot. One solid metal ring with perfectly placed receptive rings
each microscopically set at regular intervals around the metal
circle. The hooks fitted to the long end of the metal L shaped rods
or downward facing hooks, they matched the rings on the metal
wheel, like the spokes of a cart wheel. Vindec looked at the sheet
which should cover the metalwork, instead of being lumpy with
steels protruding; it now lay flat and crumpled on the back of the
empty wagon.</p>
<p class="western">Without being encouraged, the donkey pulled
against the wagon, dragging it forward and around, turning about
the outside of the standing knights. Placing itself ready for its
departure, and then standing still it bent its head low to the
ground, and began to crop the only grass Vindec had seen growing
inside of the Olar marshland.</p>
<p class="western">The King led his men after the magician who
had entered into the long room. Before them, resting, was the stone
body of a giant troll, around its neck, with its head protruding
out, supported by the trolls shoulders and its up reaching arms,
was the metal ring from the back of the wagon. Vindec hesitated, he
had expected to have to assemble the device himself, with a little
help of course he mused. Now he found that the construction was
ready and waiting for them.</p>
<p class="western">From the ring of metal, one hundred poles
extended out for seven feet, a single leg reached to the floor
supporting the furthest end of each of the L shaped metalwork.
Small oblong plates protrude a foot in from the outer most reach of
the metalwork. Each sideways reach of metal, not touching those to
either side of it. The construction had the distinctive look of a
metal table frame, without the table top fitted.</p>
<p class="western">The King walked around the construction his
back facing unknowingly to the entry into the cave of the
Lifestone. He reached to his side, watched by the gathering
knights. He withdrew the sword of power from its simple leather
sheath, placing it point facing in, he laid the three-foot-six
inches of blade onto the metal frame facing inwards to the center
which was the rock trolls head. Pommel and grip rested perfectly on
the oblong plate, then he lowered his head, communing with the
Lifestone below him. His knights, solemn and uncertain followed
their King's lead. Soon the metal work supported a wheel of blades,
each slot fitting each blade perfectly.</p>
<p class="western">The King still bearing his shield turned away
from the table of blades and approached the left wall. There, where
nothing had been before, Vindec noticed were a line of metal hooks,
seemingly giant pins, driven deep into the solid stone of the wall,
each with a carved metal hand reaching out, extending fingers out
to grasp hold of something. The King removed his shield and held it
out with his gloved hands to the first of the waiting wall fingers,
they accepted his shield, the fingers closed on metal supports
designed to make the carrying of the shield easier for the battling
knight.</p>
<p class="western">The King's shield filled the first hook,
grasped and hanging, perfectly positioned against the wall for all
to see. Each knight in order of rank and favour placed their shield
against the wall. Each fist closed around it, holding it in line
with the previous. There the shields would wait through time, until
called for by their rightful owner.</p>
<p class="western">The King looked up, before him stood a milk
white stallion; one of the finest, if not the finest of beasts to
be found anywhere throughout his realm. The horse stood patiently,
behind it, forming a perfect line, were the remaining ninety-nine
other milk white mounts. The knights formed up next to their
mounts, with the King taking his place by the side of the lead
horse.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec stepped forward around the table, he
reached up his hands and as he envisioned it the arch, opened. The
King looked across at his friend and then without further word he
entered into the tunnel. The wolf stood his ground, watching as one
by one the knights vanished. Then as swiftly as it had appeared the
portal closed, sealing them away.</p>
<p class="western">Vindec looked down at the wolf and spoke to
the creature, his only comfort now that his friend and King had
entered into the light, there to reside until the time of most need
should arise. Vindec would be waiting, he would be there to support
his King, Vindec would live on, it would be a humble life, a
watchful life, but a life with one end in sight. Someday though not
soon, he would again be stand before his King, and feel again the
pleasure and glow of true friendship. "Some day," he whispered,
heard only by the keen ears of his wolf companion.</p>
<p class="western">He turned away, filling his memory of this
place with one last look. He exited the long hall, walking across
to the waiting donkey, and taking its tether from the ground he led
both it and the wolf out of the Olar. None looked back, behind them
was the past, they looked forward, before them waited the future.
Unseen the small patch of grass withered and died, it had no place
within the Olar now that the donkey had departed.</p>
