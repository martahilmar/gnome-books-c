gnome-books-c
=============

Google Summer of Code project for GNOME, test application written in C

gnome-books is application for listing, searching and reading eBooks.

The idea is to integrate gnome-books with an existing online eBook store.

gnome-books will be implemented upon the application gnome-documents, and it is going to live in the same git repository. 
This would be a great solution regarding code duplication, because it would be possible to reuse relevant code blocks from 
gnome-documents and add extra features related to eBooks.

Using epub.js library for the reading mode.
